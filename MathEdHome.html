This page is dedicated to all the undergraduate students I have ever
taught. The educational system under the tutelage of MathEd did not
manage to break their spirits or destroy their talents, but it made
their lives more difficult than was necessary. It is up to us
to make sure that no further damage is done to the current and future
students. MathEd does not only soak up funds that are badly needed
elsewhere- it actually contributes to the continued deterioration of
the mathematics education in this country. <br>

The purpose of this web page is two-fold: <br>
<br>
-- To increase public awareness of MathEd
and the damage that I believe it is doing to the mathematics education
in this country. This page will contain essays and articles reflecting
my views on MathEd and other opinions on this subject that I find
interesting.
Your help is urgently needed! If you know a good MathEd horror story,
please send it to me at <a href="mailto:%20iosevich@math.missouri.edu">iosevich@math.missouri.edu</a>.
I may ask for some references and supporting materials, but I will then
most likely include your story on this page. <br>
<br>
-- To keep track of non-MathEd educational activities around the
country performed by serious mathematicians. If you are involved in
something like that and you are a pure (or applied)
mathematician, please email me at <a
 href="mailto:iosevich@math.missouri.edu">iosevich@math.missouri.edu</a>.<br>

<div style="text-align: center;"><big style="font-weight: bold;">Essays
and articles on MathEd</big><br>
</div>
<br>
-- The first article is a short summary of my views on MathEd and
related
matters. I do not agree with everything in all the articles here,
except possible my own, but the articles I post do have my endorsement
to a large extent. <br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.math.missouri.edu/%7Eiosevich/nayezd.html">The
danger posed by MathEd and what we can do about it, by Alex Iosevich,
June 27, 2005 </a><br>
<br>
-- The
following article by Diane Ravitch is about MathEd practitioners
graduating
from simple
everyday sort of incompetence to politically motivated
"ethnomathematics". Dr. Ravitch is a historian of education at New York
University, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, and a member
of the Koret Task Force at the Hoover Institution. <br>

by Diane Ravitch</a><br>
<br>
-- The following page contains a series of articles by Herb Wilf,
Bastiaan Braams, George Andrews, and Lynn Arthur Steen addressing the
question of whether research in mathematics education makes any sense.
The inescapable conclusion is that it makes no sense what-so-ever. <br>

curriculum at the University of Missouri-Columbia. <br>

Educational activities by serious mathematicians</big> <br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: left;">For the time being, I will just list my
own activities, but that will change soon as I start receiving
information from other mathematicians. <br>
<br>
-- <a href="http://www.math.missouri.edu/announcements/high.html">Summer
program on the Erdos distance problem</a>: This program will be
run
by Julia Garibaldi, Alex Iosevich, and Tyler Jones-Salisbury at the
University of Missouri-Columbia, August 1-5 in MSB 110, 1:00-4:00 p.m..
The purpose of the program is to familiarize motivated high school
students with the Erdos distance problem which asks for the minimal
number of distances determined by a finite point set in the Euclidean
space. Julia Garibaldi is a postdoctoral researcher at Georgia Tech.
Tyler Jones-Salisbury is a high school students who participated in a
similar program I ran last summer. <br>
