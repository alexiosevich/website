			<h1><b>Scope of Journal</b></h1>
		<p>OJAC will publish papers on a wide range of 
topics, from analysis to number theory and combinatorics, with 
emphasis on the convergence and interactions between these fields. 
&nbsp;We particularly encourage submission of articles which may have 
one of the following features:</p>
		<ol>
			<li type="1"><i>Combinatorial results and 
analytic methods. </i>
			<li type="1"><i>Analytic results and 
combinatorial methods.</i>
			<li type="1"><i>A mixture of combinatorics 
and analysis in the methods or in their applications. </i>
		</ol>
		<p>We also encourage submission of short 
<b>letters</b> (1-3 pages) describing open research problems of 
current interest that fall within the scope of the journal. The first 
1-2 pages should contain a good description of the subject matter, 
and the rest should articulate a clearly posed question to be 
resolved.</p>
