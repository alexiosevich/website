    <b>Instructor:</b> Alex Iosevich<br>

    <b>email:</b> iosevich@math.rochester.edu <br>
    <b>Office Hours: </b>10:30-11:30 MW and by appointment <br>
    <b>Textbook: </b>Complex Analysis by Donald Marshall <br>
    <b>Grading: </b>Homework (%20), In-class midterm (%30), Quizzes
    (%10), and Final (%40). <br>
    <br>
    The quizzes will be given weekly in class to make sure that the
    students are keeping up with all the proofs in real time. Quizzes
    may be given on a Monday or a Wednesday. The two lowest quiz grades
    will be dropped. The midterm will be outside of class to make the
    time parameters less restrictive. Homework assignments will be due
    every Sunday at 11:59 p.m. The two lowest homework grades will be
    dropped. <br>
    <br>
    <b>Expectations:</b> I expect every student to come to class with a
    solid grasp of all the proofs that have been presented in class up
    to that point. <br>
