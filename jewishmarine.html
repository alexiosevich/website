<p>San Francisco Chronicle reporter John Koopman, who rode with Evnin, reported
that Evnin's role was to spot Iraqi snipers and to drive a sharpshooter, a
sergeant major, and the journalist as they headed toward Baghdad. </p>
<p>Evnin was hit while shooting back after the convoy come under fire. His
wounds at first did not appear life-threatening, and Koopman recalled joking
with him about sponge baths from the nurses. But Evnin died while being evacuated
by helicopter. </p>
<p>The extended family began to sit shiva in his hometown of Burlington,
Vermont, even before the body was returned from Iraq. </p>
<p>Evnin "had always been interested in the military, even when he was a
young child," his maternal grandfather, Rabbi Maz Wall, 87, recalled in a
Jewish Telegraph Agency report. </p>
<p>Mark "always would say that his zayde was the chief rabbi of Vermont," 
his mother Mindy Evnin said. Evnin had his bar mitzva at the Conservative 
synagogue his grandfather led. </p>
<p>Rabbi Joshua Chasan, who currently leads Ohavi Zedek, recalled that Evnin
attended Hebrew school in US Army fatigues. </p>
<p>"There's no doubt about it, Mark did it his own way. Vermont is a pretty
liberal community, and this kid went into the Marine Corps." </p>
<p>Evnin's parents separated when he was six years old, and his father, Michael,
lives in Rockville, Maryland. </p>
<p>"He was my only child. I'll never be a grandmother," his mother told a
Newsday reporter from her home in South Burlington.</p>
