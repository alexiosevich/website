        On February 6 I am giving a talk at the CalTech-UCLA Analysis
        Seminar. On February 12 I am giving a colloquium talk at the
        University of Massachusetts-Lowell. On May 10-15 I am giving a
        talk at the Complex Analysis and Dynamical Systems VII
        conference in Nehariya, Israel. Sometime in between I am almost
        surely giving a talk at Kent. <br>
