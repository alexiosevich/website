This is my public travel journal where I write down some of the details
and impressions of my travels. In these entries I make <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">no effort</span> to
be <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">diplomatic</span>

If you are squeamish or are easily
offended, you should probably read something else. Several people
already had a cow over this web page and more people like them will
inevitably appear out of the woodwork in coming weeks and months. Bad
sense of humor, stupidity and metal objects lodged in the digestive
tract have always been obstacles to having a good time...&nbsp; You can
think of this page as a form of non-invasive surgery... <br>

The visit to England was wonderful, as always. The first night I stayed
with Misha and Masha in London. We had dinner at a Georgian restaurant
Tbilisi! The food was wonderful, as was Cha-cha! <br>
<br>
The following day we went to Bristol where I gave a talk and we then
proceeded to work on our finite field stuff and related things. We are
making really nice progress! I have never been happier with
mathematics. As usual, an amusing moment came... During the trip back
to London, I decided that it is possible to realize a field with
p^(n-1) elements as a subfield of a field with p^n elements, and used
this idea to construct counter-examples to everything Misha and I have
recently done. Fortunately, we eventually realized that the argument is
ridiculous... since n/(n-1) is only an integer if n=2... Embarassing
but funny...<br>

My remaining days in Iraklion were equally pleasant and interesting. On
Sunday, an earthquake woke me up as I was taking a nap in the
afternoon. I bounced a few times, then sat down in bed and bounced a
few more times. I then dressed and left the building, but the
earthquake was over by then. An amusing expeirence, though a little
scary at first. The strength of the quake was about 6.9 at the source,
but large populated areas were not effected at all. I suspect that a
6.9 earthquake in Athens would bring about a disaster of historic
proportions. It is my impression that building codes are either
non-existent or at least not followed in this country. Moreover, the
layout of Athens would make large scale rescue operations very
difficult. I am not even talking about Iraklion. Trying to send a dozen
ambulances from the hospital near the university to the downtown area
would be about as easy as reaching the moon... <br>
<br>
My last night in Iraklion, the Admiral (Themis Mitsis) and Marisa took
me out for dinner and we had a wonderful time. It was really good to
see all these people. I will miss them very much in Missouri!<br>

<br>
Mihalis and I did some work, chatted about life, had lunch, and then
did some work later in the afternoon. Then Marisa came and took me out
drinking! The bar scene in Iraklion is absolutely wonderful. We went to
three different places and by the end of the night I was not exactly
certain where I was and what my name was, but I did manage to push the
right floor button in the elevator of my hotel and open the door of my
room. What is amazing is that I felt rather good this morning, partly
because Marisa asked her friend to bring me a gyro sandwich at about
midnight. I suspect that if I had not eaten at that point, this morning
would have been much more painful. <br>

</span>My trip began in the usual fashion- flight delays. The flight
out of Boston was delayed by three hours and a subsequent flight out of
Athens was delayed by half an hour. I was quickly reminded that I was
back in Greece. When boarding was finally announced, people rushed the
gate the way lions attack a piece of meat... I was standing ten feet
away from the gate, waiting for someone to tell me to come up and show
my ticket. Needless to say, this never happened and I was one of the
last people to get on the plane. <br>
<br>
At the Iraklion airport I was so tired I did not even notice that the
taxi driver failed to turn on his meter. This allowed him to charge me
10 Euros for the trip to Hotel El Greco instead of 7 Euros. The best
taxi story came this morning. I was too lazy to take a bus to the
university, so I took a cab. This time I made sure the meter was turned
on, but the driver decided to take a little detour and pick up
coffee... The meter was running, of course, though the whole trip still
cost less than 5 Euros. The actual driving was amazing as well. The
driver drove through stop signs as if they were not there and his face
expression did not even change. He did slow down at the red lights and
occasionally even came to a full stop. This is amazing! I have been
known to roll through a few stop signs myself, (a colleague or two
might be tempted to report this to the university administration- a
whale of a story...) , but not like this! <br>

I traveled to Vancouver see Izabella Laba and then on to Victoria to
give a talk at Jozsef Solymosi's Special Session on Discrete Geometry
as a part of the annual meeting of the Canadian Mathematical Society.
The trip was a blast! I arrived on Thursday in the early afternoon and
Izabella and I immediately went out for sushi and caught up on most of
the important gossip. We then talked about Kloosterman sums in her
office and then went out for Korean BBQ- my favorite food in the whole
world! I ate so much I was still nauseous in the morning... Oh and we
drank some beer as well- how unusual! <br>
<br>
On Friday, Izabella, her student Mariah and I took a car ferry to
Victoria, located on the Vancouver Island. The view from the boat was
absolutely spectacular! <br>
<br>
My hotel room was incredibly comfortable and cheap- conference rates
are
cool. The only downside was that I had to get up to attend some talks
the following morning, but life is a bitch... :) Actually, the talks
were mostly very nice and it was great to see some old friends. <br>

Luca Brandolini came to visit me for a week, but then I realized that I
have a colloquium talk at Kent State on Thursday! So, Luca and I drove
from Columbia, Missouri to Kent, Ohio- 670 miles of corn fields, gas
stations, trees and other wonderful things. The visit was absolutely
excellent. Artyom treated us like royalty. We had three fantastic
meals, including possibly the best place of snow crab legs I have ever
had at the place called "Rusty Nail". Luca gave a seminar talk, and I
gave a colloquium talk followed by a seminar talk the following
morning. The interaction with the audience before and after each talk
was&nbsp; very satisfying. <br>
<br>
The drive back was particularly interesting. We took a detour in order
to have dinner in my favorite Mongolian BBQ restaurant in Sharonville,
near Cincinnati. The meal was just as wonderful as I expected and the
waitress remembered me from years before!<br>
<br>
At some point during the trip back, I decided that I absolutely
need to check my email, so Luca and I got off at the T**** H**** exit
and found a H****** inn. I walked into the lobby and tried to use my
laptop, but the bastards have their wireless connection password
protected. Fortunately, we soon located a H****** inn where the
wireless access is free and the couches are even more comfortable! I
checked my email. sent out a few messages, and got back into the car
happy and fulfilled... Internet accessl is no longer a convenience or a
luxury- it is a basic necessity of life! <br>

The Integers conference was a blast! Julia and I made much progress on
our book, Bill and I discussed some Szemeredi-Erdos problems in vector
spaces over finite fields, and I attended some interesting talks. My
talk seems to have gone pretty well. No tomatoes were thrown in my
direction- a testament to the moderation and tolerance of the
participants. <br>
<br>
The after conference activities were also quite excellent. Bill and I
bought a football at WalMart and had lots of fun with it! Derrick
joined us on Saturday morning and we nearly killed ourselves running
around on wet grass. Oh, I almost forgot! On Friday night, Bill, Julia,
John Buendi and I went out for some Mexican food and Bill and I each
had a HUGE margarita. Unfortunately, for me this escapade resulted in a
grade A headache and a stomach disorder. It was lots of fun though, so
I do not mind at all. <br>
<br>
I forgot to mention something extremely important... I saw no whales on
this trip, not a single one! Whales are hard to find these days,
whereas sharks and snakes are plentiful...<br>

I returned home a few hours ago. It was an amazing day. Well, judge for
yourself. On Tuesday evening I drove to the Kansas City airport, stayed
in a hotel, and took a 7:00 a.m. flight to Atlanta. Upon my arrival, I
took a shuttle to Georgia Tech and walked to Skiles, the mathematics
building. Julia Garibaldi was very surprised to see me, and I found
that odd as we had agreed that she would drive me to the Integers 2005
conference the following day, or so I thought. After a short
conversation it became clear that the conference is next week and I
arrived exactly one week early! For about two hours I did not know
whether to laugh or cry!! In the end, I decided to laugh, but it took a
little while. I had lunch with Julia, Bill McClain and Derrick Hart,
and then Bill drove me to the airport. I am going back to Atlanta next
week... Life of a spaced-out mathematician... <br>

Shark alert! Shark alert! Everybody out of the water! Wining and
sniveling regarding my web page is continuing. It seems that
people who do not have a sufficiently solid background in liberal
education sometimes have difficulty distinguishing between bias towards
their subject area and a systematically arrived at opinion that their
professional views are intellectually worthless. <br>

The trip to Armenia was extremely educational in some ways. The
harmonic analysis conference I attended took place in Izikadzor, a
resort town high in the mountains. Water was typically turned off at
night, so if I happened to go to the bathroom between the hours of
11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m., I used cleaning pads for my computer screen,
of which I fortunately had many. The internet connection was largely
disfunctional and seemed to fail precisely at the moments when I was
about to send an email. <br>
<br>
The conference itself was quite good, with many excellent lectures and
productive discussions afterwards. Armenian mathematics is going
through a difficult period right now, with few current journal or books
coming in. However, many strong mathematicians and mathematics students
remain, and there is every reason to believe that in time the situation
will get much better. <br>
<br>
In the middle of the conference, an excursion to several ancient local
monestaries was organized. The architecture and the surrounding
scenerey was absolutely breathtaking. I will post several pictures from
the excursion on this web page in the next few days. <br>
<br>
There one story I absolutely cannot resist telling. On the way out of
Armenia I flew to Amstermdam on Aramavia airlines. About fifteen
minutes before the flight landed in Amsterdam, several people got up,
took their luggage out of overhead compartments, and started moving
towards the door. Flight attendants made a feeble attempt to out an end
to this process, but to no avail! One of the passangers brushed my head
with his suitcase as he stumbled towards the door as the plane was
headed towards the landing, and looked at me rather angrily for getting
in his way... An amazing trip!<br>

I flew into Atlanta last night, had dinner and a few drinks with
Michael Lacey, and was picked up by Julia Garibaldi and her husband
Skip and taken to their beautiful house. The house is small but very
nice and comfortable. The guest room is great! I slept incredibly well
and woke up rested and ready to face the world of the Erdos distance
problem and other scary things. In the morning, Julia and drove to
Georgia Tech where Julia had to attend an introductory meeting for new
faculty. In meantime, I talked to Dimitry Bilyk, who is a postdoc at
GTech now, and then had coffee with Yang Wang,&nbsp; the co-author of
the famous Long Wang (no joke) previously mentioned in this journal.
After talking about finite fields a bit, Julia and I drove to China
Town and had a wonderful buffet style lunch. We then drove back to the
house and worked on the book, followed by a trip to Emory for Friday
afternoon drinks. Julia had to leave early to finish up dinner party
preparations, and Skip and I followed soon after. <br>
<br>
The party is going on right now and it is a blast! Carne asada, rice,
beans, and margaritas are all great. Eric Brussel, my graduate school
classmate and Skip's colleague at Emory, just showed up and we are
catching up as we have not seen each other in many years. His wife,
Emily Hamilton, was my graduate school and college classmate, and I
hope to see her sometime this weekend. <br>

I was still up at 3:30 a.m. this morning and needed some food really
badly. I ran upstairs, looked inside the refrigerator and the pantry,
and quickly realized that improvization will be required. What I came
up with is diet experts' nightmare! I deep fried large cooked white
beans in reused olive oil with bacon and black pepper. Boy, did that
take the hunger away! And it tastes pretty good, too... as surprising
as that sounds... <br>

The trip home was fairly uneventful though several amusing things
happened. In the passport line at the Athens airport, a couple of
teenage girls from Toronto asked me where I am from and when I am
getting home. It was noon at the time and I said that I should be home
by midnight. One of them responded that this is great as I will be home
in twelve hours... <br>
<br>
In the airplane flight to JFK I set next to a very interesting Cornell
student, Juliana Oliviera, originally from Brasil and currently living
in North Carolina where her parents are medical researchers at Duke.
Life in Cornell sound very similar to that in the University of Chicago
where I was an undergraduate students so many years ago... :). <br>

My European trip is almost over and it has been a good one! Mathematics
went extremely well, I met some interesting people!<br>

<br>
</span>I got up at 7:00 a.m. or so, took a shower and went to the post
office to mail some shit. The post office downtonw Iraklion is an
amazing place. It seems to have about twice as many people as necessary
and all of them have the "I don't give a shit" attitude that is
practically written on their faces. <br>
<br>
It is now 10:13 a.m. and I am in Mihalis' office talking about the
wonders of the local post office. <br>
<br>
Maria just told me a horror story about the Atlanta post office. They
returned one package twice, though it appears that Greeks were
responsible the first time since the package actually made it to Greece
and came back... <br>
<br>
It is about 5:15 p.m. and we are on the way to a small local beach. I
plan to sit in the shade and sip on a cold drink. I am not a fish!<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">July 12,
2005</span> <br>
<br>
It is 2:40 a.m. and I just got back from a very pleasant walk and a
gyros sandwich. Streets are still full of people and insane drivers.
Mathematics is going well and music I downloaded from Svetlana
Roudenko is smoking! Life is good... <br>
<br>
I finally made it to the department at 4:00 p.m. and did a little
typing before Mihalis got back from driving Maria home. Nikos began his
potty training today! <br>
<br>
At 7:15 p.m. I gave my talk, which seems to have gone well. The dinner
afterwards was extremely good. I filled up on mashed yellow split peas-
my favorite Greek food! <br>
<br>
After dinner, George, Yang, Mate and I went to play some pool.
Unfortunately, fatigue and bad medication management caught up with me
and I did not really enjoy the
experience. I will go to sleep pretty soon and should be better by
tomorrow. <br>
<br>
By the way, the pool hall has wireless service, but it requires the use
of a wireless access card which they do not sell... <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">July 11,
2005</span><br>
<br>
Yang woke me up at 9:00 a.m. to have breakfast! Fortunately, it turns
out that Mihalis will not be at work until 2:00 p.m., so Yang and I
went to take a nap in our respective rooms and will meet up for lunch
in a few minutes. It is not 12:50 p.m. and I feel like a million bucks.
I will feel like two million bucks the moment I have some more good
local food! <br>
<br>
Well, Yang insisted on air conditioning, so we ended up eating in an
overpriced touristy place with mediocre food. No big deal. Calories are
calories... Not really... We then took a cab to the university. The
taxi driver did not know the word "university" in English. Actually, it
was not at all clear he knew this word in Greek either, but we somehow
got to Mihalis' office and spent a very pleasant afternoon and early
evening talking about mathematics, listening to Mihalis bitch about my
Mac, and discussing various aspects of Greek history. <br>
<br>
Yang gave a very nice talk in the evening on topics related to CD
manufacturing. One of his co-authors is named Long Wang... It was very
difficult for me to concentrate on the talk after that name came up as
memories of Clarence Thomas hearings sprang to mind... When the
question period came, I really felt like asking: "...so how long is
Long Wang?", but I contained myself somehow. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">July 10,

<br>
The trip was fairly uneventful, except that from Strasbourg to Paris I
was on a French train, which means that first class seats are about as
good as German second class seats... Half the lights in my compartment
did not work and there were no electrical outlets. First class French
style... :). <br>
<br>
After arriving at La Gare L'Est, I took metro to Charles de Gaulle
Airport, which cost me 8 Euros... It costs 2$ to go from Hyde Park in
Chicago to the O'Hare airport, which I suspect is a greater distance...
I am not even mentioning their foreign policy... :)... <br>
<br>
I am now in Athens airport using a wireless pass I bought for 10 Euros
for three hours. Not bad given that it costs about twice as much in
France or Germany. The food on the flight was excellent and my seat was
perfectly comfortable. Of course, I was immediately reminded of the
fact that I am in the Mediterranean region. As I was standing in line
for the bathroom, the man behind me asked me to step aside so that he
can continue with his walk around the airplane. As soon as I stepped
aside, he jumped into the bathroom that just opened up...
Spectacular... When the plane landed, another dude about half my size
basically stuck an elbow in my ribs in order to get his bag out of the
luggage shelf before me... I wondered mometarily what his plan was if I
shoved an elbow in his ribs, but then I quickly realized that my
experience with my own department suggests that the gamble there was
precisely that I would not respond and simply step aside. Thiis is
precisely what I did, by the way... <br>
<br>
Mihalis and Yang met me at the airport and we went to Mihalis' in-laws'
farm to have a drink. I was quite tired, so Mihalis then drove me to
the El Greco Hotel where I caught up on sleep and then went out to
dinner with Yang and a bunch of nice Greek people. We had a wonderful
meal. It was great to be in Germany, but it is nice to be eating Greek
food... <br>
<br>
After dinner I found an internet cafe, caught up on email and went to
bed. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">July 9,
2005</span> <br>
<br>
I barely rolled out of bad at 9:05 a.m., took a shower, brushed my
teeth, packed my s*** and went to the library to bulls*** with the
departing mathematicians and check my email. At 10:40 a bunch of us
took a taxi to the train station and took off for Offenburg where
Detlef and Co. caught a train to Hambuurg, and Svetlana and I met up
with a friend of Svetlana's father, a physicist from a research center
outside of Moscow. <br>
<br>
After leaving our stuff at Sveta's hotel, the three of us went into
town, had some German food, walked around, mailed some postcards,
shopped, and took a bunch of photographs. We are now in Cafe Einstein
resting and munching on ice cream. Life is good! <br>
<br>
It is 11:31 p.m. and my train is about to depart for Strassbourg, where
I will catch a connecting train to Paris. Svetlana and Alexei walked me
to the train station and photographed me next to an empty single train
cart, which makes it look like I have a personal train! <br>
<br>
This was an absolutely fantastic day. After the aforementioned Cafe
Einstein, we took a walk around Offenburg and found... a clothing
store. Svetlana suggested that we let her shop for "twenty minutes or
so". I returned in 35 minutes and she was not even close to being
done... In fact, it took a while to even find her inside the store
because she was in a dressing room. I walked past all the rooms until I
finally recognized her gym shoes under one of the doors. I was then
able to report to Alexei thatt Svetlana is in fact alive... <br>
<br>
After surviving that glorious shopping spree the three of us walked
around some more and checked Svetlana and Alexei into Hotel Central. We
then went out for dinner to a classical German restaurant where we had
schnitzels and steaks. I like German food, but, to be honest, I am
ready for a different cuisine for a while. Well, the train is about to
leave! Bon voyage, Alex! <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">July 8,
2005</span><br>
<br>
This is the last day of the conference. Two more talks to go and that
will be that... I lost my first game of ping pong on this trip. Alex
Ionescu beat me fair and square. I asked for a rematch this evening.
Alex is lots of fun to play as he has a very nice defensive style. <br>
<br>
Tomorrow Svetlana and I are going to Offenburg. I will catch an
overnight train to Paris and tomorrow morning I fly like a bird to
Athens. I have no clue how I am getting to Iraklion, but I always
manage one way or another. <br>
<br>
I heard a wonderful joke from Rodolfo Torres! Here it is: <br>
<br>
A man complained to his friend that his shoulder hurts. His friend told
him that this is not a problem and suggested a coin operated machine at
the train station where you put in a dollar and a urine same, and
receive a diagnosis...<br>
<br>
The man went to the machine, put in a dollar and his urine sample and
received a report which said that he has shoulder pain resulting from
playing too much tennis. The report also said that he needs to take
aspirin and rest for fifteen days.<br>
<br>
Well... The man was very perplexed and decided to fool the machine. He
collected urine samples from is daughter, his wife, and his dog,
masturbated into the container and mixed it all together. He then went
to the machine and put in a dollar and his new "sample". The machine
took a while to think and then came out with the following report:<br>
<br>
(1) Your dog has parasites.<br>
<br>
(2) Your daughter is taking drugs.<br>
<br>
(3) Your wife is pregnant and you are not the father.<br>
<br>
(4) If you do not stop masturbating, your shoulder will never heal...<br>

Some wonderful talks took place today! Thiele, Kolountzakis and Muscalu
gave fantastic lectures in the morning, and the afternoon talks were
excellent as well. Roast pork was served for lunch, accompanied by
potatoes stuffed with broccoli- delicious! Dinner was not incredibly
filling, but a bunch of us went down to Oberwalfach as usual and got
our fill of protein. <br>
<br>
After dinner I played ping-pong with Fernando Soria and Camil Muscalu.
I also played foosball with Stephanie Petermichl, Rodolfo Torres and
Michael Lacey. Rodolfo is really good at this game, and he does not
even score goals with his hand like Maradona! <br>
<br>
Svetlana Roudenko and I did some singing again, and a bunch of us is
now discussing discrimination against women in academia in Germany and
United States. <br>

It is 11:22 a.m. and I just woke up. I was up until 1:30 a.m. talking
to Jim Colliander and Tony Carbery. Chris Sogge, Duong Phong, Mihalis
Kolountzakis, Michael Lacey and others went to sleep earlier. Jim had
an
amazing story, as usual. He pointed out that 666/212 gives you Pi up to
five digits. In other words, the number of the beast divided by the
boiling point of water in Fahrenheit is nearly Pi! This must have some
cosmic significance..<br>
<br>
I missed all the morning talks and I am hungry as hell... I guess it is
time to talke a shower and get ready for lunch! By the way, dear
colleague, if you are reading this, I have not seen any whales
lately, even in my dreams... <br>
<br>
The lunch was meager! I have no idea how I survived until dinner.
Mathematics went pretty well, though, and life is good overall. Dinner
was not incredibly filling either, but Michael Lacey, Hart Smith and I
went down to Oberwalfach afterwards and had some meat! They had some
sausage and I had a schnitzel stuffed with ham and cheeze. I am now
even more happy with the world than I usually am. It is time for some
good cognac... <br>
<br>
I am having so much fun at this conference. A whole bunch of us spent
about an hour calculating Erdos numbers of various mathematicians.
Svetlana and I sang some Russian songs from the Israeli KVN site. We
then moved to the exercise room and played some ping-pong followed by a
game of foosball. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">July 5,

<br>
I got up early and made a couple of phone calls. It is absolutely
wonderful to walk around outside at about 6:00 a.m.. Beautiful mist is
everywhere! The mountains, clouds, pastures and the sky all blend
together like a dream. The air is fresh and invigorating. <br>
<br>
It is 11:10 a.m. and there is one more lecture this morning. Both
morning lectures were really good, but I am a little tired. Lack of
exercise is beginning to get to me. <br>
<br>
Jim Colliander has arrived! I have not seen him in years. Some beer
drinking is definitely on the agenda now...&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Jim told me a few minutes ago that he wants to have a few beers with
me, but not too many because he needs to take advantage of this rare
opportunity to work without distractions. We will see... <br>
<br>
It is 10:37 p.m. and a bunch of us is sitting around the table drinking
and munching on fruit. Dinner was bizarre! We went down to the village
to the pre-arranged place. We were served ham and cheese salad... and
nothing else. Michael Lacey, Chris Sogge, Mihalis Koluntzakis, and I,
and several others ordered more food. I had some outstanding pork and
potatoes in a wonderful mushroom sauce. We had a couple of bottles of
Riesling wine along with the meal. <br>
<br>
After returning to the Institute we discovered that internet is not
working! A whole evening without internet! I guess alcohol will have to
do... <br>
<br>
By the way, my talk seems to have gone well. I was so nervous, I
finished ten minutes early. About five minutes before the end of my
talk, a cow started mooing in the distance and would not stop. I
wondered aloud whether that was a moo of approval or disapproval...<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">July 4,

<br>
Oberwalfach is absolutely great! The rooms are comfortable, the library
is excellent, the food is perfectly fine, and it is great to see
everybody as always. The scenery is magnificent with tree covered
mountains and cows out on the hilly pastures. Beer and other other
refershments are plentiful and the wireless connection, which I am
using right now, completes the heavenly atmosphere. The first lecture
was at 9:00 a.m. this morning but it was excellent. Carlos Kenig talked
about unique continuation. <br>
<br>
It is 11:06 p.m. and Michael and I just got back from our second dinner
of the night down in the village. I had a goulash soup and ox tongue,
and Michael and I shared a bottle of local wine. Before we left, we had
a bottle of nice German Riesling wine from Alsace. Life is good! By the
way, after we finished out meal we discovered that the restaurant we
were in is cash only! The bill was 29.30 Euro and I had 26.90 Euro!
Once the owner found out we are from MOF, he just told us to bring the
money tomorrow. <br>
<br>
I am giving a talk tomorrow and the rest of the conference will be
easier to enjoy once that pressure is out of of the way. I am tired as
hell, so I am going to sleep! Well, I will probably write a couple of
letters first. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">July 3,
2005</span> <br>
<br>
I need to get some sleep and then go to Oberwalfach! I cannot wait to
see that legendary library with WiFi access that I do not have to pay
for! <br>
<br>
It is 12:02 p.m.. I am about to try to buy train tickets to reach
Oberwalfach. The hotel room at InterHotel was somewhat disappointing.
The bathroom was spacious and the bed was large enough, but lack of air
conditioning was highly annoying. I keep telling people that there is
no need to worry about destroying the environment because humans will
surely find a way to finish each other off long before that becomes
relevant! So crank up those air conditioners and at least we will go in
style... <br>
<br>
It is 12:25 p.m. and I have tickets for Hausach from where I can
supposedly take a taxi to MOF. The train leaves at 12:59 and I need to
change trains at Karlsruhe. The whole trip takes two and a half hours.
This is not a problem as the train station is quite interesting. <br>
<br>
It is 2:57 p.m. and I will be in Hausach in 24 minutes. A short taxi
ride later I should be in MOF where I can find a shower and WiFi!
Heaven is within reach! I also heard rumors of high quality alcohol at
nominal rates. How do people work in that place?! <br>
<br>
Oberwalfach meeting is a good opportunity to snag some papers for OJAC,
which should lead to some entertaining conversations. <br>
<br>
I am reading from Moscow to Petushki by Erofeev. The book is absolutely
hilarious, though I suspect any attempt to translate it into English
would fail miserably. I suspect that any Western medical doctor would
tell you that alcohol consumption, meticulously described by Erofeev in
the book, would kill a healthy adult elephant...&nbsp; I am also pretty
sure that Erofeev's description of Soviet workplace would be
interpreted as a sort of an allegory or a creative exaggeration.
Fortunately, after listening to stories by my father and his friends
all of my life, I am quite sure that what Erofeev describes is quite
literally true and goes a long way towards explaining the collapse of
the former Soviet Union and current conditions in Russia. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">July 2,
2005</span> <br>
<br>
I woke up reasonably early and had a nice breakfast. I am staying in
Novotel Strasbourg Sud, a reasonably priced hotel about a 15-20 minute
drive from the train station. The hotel web page says that they are 10
minutes away, but Philippe told me that this is a "standard
exaggeration". The hotel web page also mentions WiFi internet, but
neglects to mention that there is 12 Euro/day fee to use it... Another
charming aspect of this hotel is that you have to boil your own eggs at
breakfast. This is fine, but one first needs to figure out how to use
the demonic egg boiler they have... All in all, I suspect that it would
have been better and cheaper to stay in hotel near the train station.
No big deal though. <br>
<br>
My email to graduate students was forwarded by the department. I had
one response so far and it was quite positive. The tricky point here is
that many graduate students will be applying for teaching positions
after they graduate, so it is probably safer for them not to voice
their opinions in favor of my essay too loudly. <br>
<br>
I do not have to leave the hotel room until noon, so I will use the
opportunity to rest a bit more. I will then take a taxi to the train
station followed where I hope to figure out how to get to Oberwalfach.
Then I will head into Germany. There is a concentration camp site near
Stuttgart that I am considering visiting. <br>
<br>
It is 1:15 p.m. and I am on a train to Stuttgart. It appears that
German 2ond class train cars are as good as French 1st class train
cars. Crossing the Rhine and going past forests and fields reminded me
of a Discovery channel show on Roman conquests. At one point the
narrator, who had a deep dramatic voice, said something like: "The
Romans conquered Gaul... Then they crossed the Rhine and discovered
that German barbarians were much tougher than Gaulic barbarians..."
This was absolutely hilarious. I wonder if the Discovery channel
received an official protest from the French ambassador. On second
thought, if the French ambassador sent out protests like that, he would
not have much time left for anything else... <br>
<br>
Oh s***! I need to finish the Erdos notes for my summer program in
August... I am really looking forward to that. It is not yet clear who
is going to show up for the program, but even three or four students is
enough if they are motivated. The undergraduate part of the program is
potentially equally interesting. It could give me a preview of my
advanced calculus class and my problem solving class. <br>
<br>
Stuttgart is a very pleasant city. I did not get the chance to see much
because I arrived fairly late and was quite tired, but I saw a few
churches and plazas and nice looking old houses up on the hill. I will
have to come back here for a more thorough visit some day. <br>

<br>
It is 9:34 a.m. and the Ph.D. defense of Hermine has begun exactly four
minutes after the scheduled start. It is something about Brownian
motion and looks interesting. I decided to skip the second Ph.D.
defense of the day to do a bit of work. The topics of both
dissertations sound interesting and I will probably try to obtain a
copy of each.<br>
<br>
It is 8:10 p.m. and I am on a train to Strasbourg. My seat is very
comfortable and even has an electrical outlet for my laptop. I am about
1 hour away from Strasbourg- we passed Nancy a little while ago. The
scenery out of the train window is wonderful! Unfortunately, I am
incredibly tired from working almost around the clock in the past few
days, so I have spent most the trip sleeping. This is not a problem,
however, because I need to get back to Paris anyways to catch a plane
to Athens on July 10. I will catch up on sight-seeing then. <br>

<br>
My last full day in Orleans went well. Philippe and I finished most of
the paper we are writing, I uploaded some updated .html files on my web
page, finished my laundry which got wet in the rain earlier in the day,
and went out to dinner with Philippe in the evening to a very nice
restaurant downtown. I am enjoying Orleans very much, but, as usual, I
am really looking forward to the next stage- Strasbourg and
Oberwalfach! <br>
<br>
Tomorrow evening, comfortably situated in a Strasbourg hotel with WiFi
access, I will summarize my experiences in France and will make a
determination on whether the French civilization has a future... :)<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">June 29,
2005</span> <br>
<br>
Philippe, Ann-Gael and I went out to Le Tonnelier last night, a
wonderful
restaurant near the Cathedral in Orleans. I had scallops in an herb
cream sauce, smoked salmon, an assortment of cheezes, an apple pie with
caramelized apples on top, and Kenyan coffee. We also had a couple of
nice bottles of wine with the meal. The food was wonderful and the
atmosphere was great! <br>
<br>
Still on the agenda is the Orleans art museum, a castle in the Loire
valley, and the jazz festival that is going on in Orleans this week. On
Friday I take a train to Strasbourg where I managed to snag a hotel
room with WiFi access! On Saturday and Sunday I will do some work and
some touring, and on Sunday evening I will arrive at Oberwalfach. <br>
<br>
Philippe had to proctor an examination in the afternoon, so I took a
tram downtown, strolled around, and thought about life and mathematics.
I found a cute little cafe where I had some tea and a delicious desert
crepe with pineapple and raisins. And finally, I found the one food
item the British do better than the French! It is afternoon tea! I did
not get milk with my tea and the cookies that came with were not very
good. The crepe was truly out of this world, which made up for
everything... Afterwards, I bought some nice postcards, found another
cafe with a view of the Cathedral and did some writing. <br>
<br>
Later in the evening, Philippe, Ann-Gael and I went to the Orleans Jazz
Fest nearby. The first half of the program was very nice and I enjoyed
it thoroughly. The weather was perfect! It rained earlier in the day,
so the air was cool and fresh. After coming back to Philippe's place,
we had a couple of whiskys, talked about life, and then went to sleep.
Life is good... <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">June 28,
2005</span> <br>
<br>
My talk went pretty well. Many questions were asked and the discussion
spilled over to drinks afterwards. One of the people asking questions
was Athanasios Bakakis, a mathematician originally from Crete who knows
Mihalis Koluntzakis well. <br>
<br>
Soon after my talk, Philippe and I went to get a haircut, so I now look
almost respectable. On Friday I will take a train to Strasbourg where I
managed to book a hotel with WiFi! On Sunday I will make my way to
Oberwalfach and on Saturday I will tour Strasbourg and the surrounding
area. The trip to Provence did not work out this time around. Oh well. <br>

<br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Philippe picked me up at around 8:30 p.m. and took
me to his beautiful house. It is located next to a small and very old
castle. The house is reasonably spacious and has a very nice yard with
trees all around. We had a wonderful meal outside consisting of a
salad, pork pate, bruschetta, cheese quiche, and a variety of cheeses.
A couple of very nice bottles of cabernet sauvignon were consumed in
the process. We finished off the meal with a bowl of cherries and
raspberries. Life is good! <br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When I checked my male and browsed the internet I
discovered that the counter on my traveljournal page is over 100 hits.
Rudnev was right! <br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is now 2:03 a.m. and I am having trouble
sleeping because while the meal was wonderful, the carbohydrate content
was probably too high for my physiology. Oh well, I will just catch up
on my blogging activities. <br>
</p>
It is 9:40 p.m. and I am incredibly full and tipsy. Philippe made some
tomato and garlic pasta which we consumed with some red wine. We had
cherries and raspberries for desert. I am now fed and happy and unable
to do anything except digest. <br>
<br>
The day at the university was very good. I met Jean-Philippe Anker who
is now the zookeeper at Orleans. I
did not realize that he was here, so it was a very pleasant surprise. <br>
<br>
Tomorrow I give a talk at the seminar and then Philippe and I are going
to get a haircut. When we get back to the house, I will do laundry. I
will show up at Oberwalfach with clean clothes and trimmed hair. I may
even shave for the occasion! <br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="mathed4"></a><br>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">June 26, 2005</span><br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I went to sleep at 10:00 p.m. last night and woke
up at 11:00 a.m. this morning, give or take a few minutes. The shower
was in a separate room,&nbsp; on the opposite end of the corridor from
the toilet... Vive la France!<br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">At 11:45 a.m. I arrived at the train station and
bought a ticket to Orleans. Philippe, here I come! I hope you know what
you are getting yourself into... <br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I hope that Misha and Masha are recovering quickly
from my visit. For two days now they did not have to listen to the
music recorded on my computer, or suffer numerous updates on the
Missouri Road Runner Show. Masha said that they will be fine after
visiting a therapist... I suspect that a couple of bottles of wine and
eight hours of sleep may do the trick :). Philippe may not get off this
easy because he is, after all, French, and will have to suffer daily
wake up calls along the lines of: "Wake up Philippe! The Germans are
crossing the Rhine...". Once, when Philippe was staying at my house in
Missouri, I tried to wake him up by yelling: "Wake up Philippe! The
Italians are crossing the Alps...". He ignored me at first, and them
mumbled: "... that would not wake up anybody...". <br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is 1:23 p.m. and I am on a train headed for
Paris, St. Lazare. My train to Orleans leaves from Paris, Austerlitz.
I have no idea where that is, but I imagine it cannot too difficult to
figure out.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is 2:21 p.m.. and I am still on the way to
Paris. I am detecting an amusing pattern in French trains. The
conductor does not seem to check tickets in 1st class and checks them
rather carefully in 2ond class. The conductor has been through the
first class car many times and did not check tickets even once. I
conjecture that a reasonably safe way to ride for free is to dress
reasonably well and get on a 1st class car at a time when it is not
likely to be very full. I would not actually do this myself, of course,
but I enjoy making note of criminal possibilities. <br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Oberwalfach meeting will be a blast. Many fun
people will be around and mathematics will be very exciting as well. It
seems that the library there has WiFi, so I will be able to catch up on
my web page activities, even if I do not manage to take care of that in
Orleans. <br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A loose thought. Should I provide a translation to
the second quote on my web page, or should I let whoever is interested
investigate it on their own? A simple translation would not do it
anyways. As is often the case, context is everything! <br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Another loose though. Brandolini! If you are
reading this, where the h*** are you and when the f*** are you coming
to Missouri? Did you forget my email address?! How is Maestro? How is
Giancarlo? <br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is 4:50 p.m. and I am on the train to Orleans.
I took a cab from St. Lazare to Austrerlitz in order to see a bit of
Paris. We went past the Louvre and I got to see Notre Dame and Eiffel
Tower at a distance! <br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I did not get the chance to call Philippe, so I
will have to get in touch with him once I reach Orleans. He must be
wondering where the h*** I am by now. It should be a fun week. I am
really looking forward to it. <br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Steve Senger and Dwight Thieme! If you are reading
this, how is Courant and John book coming along? <br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Tyler! Have you proved the Besicovitch/Kakeya
conjecture yet? Is my office still in one piece? <br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">My seat has an electrical outlet built in. This is
really cool because I can recharge my laptop to a certain extent. I may
have to wait for Philippe for a while at the train station in Orleans,
so it will be nice to have something to play with. <br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is 8:12 p.m. and I am sitting next to the
statue of Jean d'Arc on a horse waiting for Philippe to arrive. It is a
beautiful little plaza with a bunch of restaurants, cafes and even a
Merry-Go-Round! The heat is still stifling, even at this hour. Jean is
looking good- the last Frenchwoman to defeat the English. No Frenchman
ever managed anything like that... <br>

</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Making plans is nice, but reality always takes
over. When I arrived in Cherbourg, the attendant at the train station
told me that to get to the Utah beach, I need to take a train to Caen
and then take a bus. When I arrived in Caen, I was told that I need to
take a train back to Bayueux and go from there. In Bayueux I found a
room in a hotel for 19 Euros and a five hour tour of D-Day sites for 37
Euros. I got back from the tour about an hour ago and it was absolutely
wonderful. We went to a D-Day museum, a German artillery bunker, the
Omaha beach, the American military cemetery at the Omaha beach, and
Point du Hoc where American rangers scaled the cliffs and destroyed
large German artillery pieces that endangered both the Utah beach and
Omaha beach landings. The Omaha beach visit was especially haunting. It
looks so peaceful now, but 863 Americans died there in just a few
hours. There were over 4000 American casualties at the Omaha beach
overall, including the wounded and the captured. <br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This is slightly off the subject, but I wish to
assure everyone that during my tour today, I did not see a single
whale.
Not one... <br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I strolled around downtown Bayueux and found La
Fringale, a
wonderful little restaurant with outdoor seating. This where I am now.
I am sipping on some semi-dry white wine, and waiting for a bowl of
French onion soup, followed by a fillet of sole. Heaven is located in
Bayueux this evening!<br>
</p>
Tomorrow I will get up when I get up, and I will
take a train to Orleans to visit Philippe Jaming for a week. If I get
up early, I may try to visit Rouen, but I suspect that I will sleep in.<br>

<p class="MsoNormal">The last few days in Bristol were filled with
political discussions involving things I was recently asked not to talk
about... Details will appear in my memoirs, if I live that long... <br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Mathematics is going well! Misha and I finished a
paper on lower bounds for L2 spherical means of Fourier transforms of
sign indefinite measures and submitted it to the Math Research Letters.
We feel good about that paper and there is much left to do. <br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I am writing this on Friday, June 24, at 7:55 p.m.
on the train from Bristol to Poole via Southampton. When I reach Poole
I need to somehow find my hotel which is 6 miles or so away from the
city. Tomorrow morning at 7:00 a.m. I will take a ferry to Cherbourg,
followed by a motorcycle ride to the Utah beach. It will be lots of
fun! I always wanted to visit Utah and Omaha beaches where American
soldiers came ashore in the morning of D-Day, June 6, 1944. <br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is 10:30 p.m.. on Friday, June 24, and I am in
a pub next to the harbor in Poole. I found out from a fellow train
passenger that there is a midnight ferry to Cherbourg, so I am
by-passing the hotel and heading straight for Cherbourg. I get to sleep
in a reclining seat and there is a shower on board- what more can a man
ask for! In the morning I will take a train straight to the Utah beach
and will go from there. <br>

On Wednesday morning I left St. Louis, and
after a stop in Cincinnati, where I bought a copy of the Da Vinci Code,
I
boarded an Air France flight to Paris. The person sitting next to me
was a
plump Austrian exchange student named Melinda. In the first ten minutes
of our
conversation she informed me that she is uncomfortable around Turks and
that
there are lots of them where she is from. My interest in any further
discussions quickly waned and I proceeded to concentrate on the Da
Vinci Code,
an unforgivable 400-page exercise in murder of trees, though mildly
entertaining. The fact that the Vatican heavily criticized the Da Vinci
Code
created a moral imperative for me to buy the book and read it, and I do
not
regret the experience even though the novel is rather shallow and of
dubious
historical veracity. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--><!--[endif]-->
After landing in Paris, I immediately
experienced the wonders of being in France. Charles de Gaulle airport
is a
sprawling disorganized disaster where directions are poorly marked and
the information
staff is incompetent, even in their own language. I eventually figured
out
where to buy tickets for Cherbourg and took off. Since I was saving
Bristol
money by taking the train, I bought first class tickets and enjoyed a
very
pleasant ride through the scenic French countryside. In the early
afternoon I
arrived in Cherbourg where I got a hotel room and slept very soundly
through
the rest of the afternoon and early evening, with periodic breaks to
read the
Da Vinci Code. I finally got out of bed at about 8:00 p.m. and took a
nice
stroll around the city. I found a place to check my email and later
settled on
a cute little restaurant next to the plaza with a big statue of
Napoleon on a
horse. The meal was outstanding. I had several beers and some veal with
Provencal sauce and noodles. The waitress was not rude, by French
standards, so
I left a nice tip, also by French standards. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--><!--[endif]-->
On the morning of June 17 I took a ferry to
Poole, England. I almost missed the ferry because the idiots at Charles
de Gaulle
failed to stamp my passport, so the customs officials at the ferry port
were
wondering how exactly I entered the country. I had five minutes to
board the
ferry, so I pretended not to understand French, and since they did not
speak
any English (f******* customs officials in Cherbourg on the f******
English
Channel!) they just let me go&#8230;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How did
that country last this long?! Yeah, I know&#8230; periodic American
assistance, for
which they are deeply ungrateful What are you going to do&#8230; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--><!--[endif]-->
After arriving in Poole, I walked over to
the train station and boarded a train to Bristol. I had to switch
trains in
Southamton. My connecting train was late and the announcements were
misleading
outright stupid. I expect more from England, but European influence is
difficult
to shake off. Well, that is not entirely fair. German trains still run
mostly
on time as far as I know. </span></p>

When I arrived in Bristol I learned that
Michael Rudnev is getting tenure after an initial decision to fire him.
I guess
there are occasional limits to butt ugly with head up your a** type

We celebrated wildly and will continue to do so for several days, I
suspect. </span></p>

One of the professors at Bristol asked me
if I believe that GW is the worst President in American history. I
responded
that GW is not too impressive, but Jimmy Carter was much worse, partly
because he gave Democrats a bad name for many years to come. I

earned a disapproving glance and comments about living in Missouri&#8230; Go

My trip to New York was a blast! It was great to see Mel, Sinai,
Izabella, Julia, Sinan, Jozsef, and many many others. The lectures were
excellent, except mine, of course, and meals, especially Korean BBQ,
were absolutely outstanding. <br>
<br>
It is always a pleasure to interact with people who have a very similar
sense of humor to mine. During one of the lunches it came out that John
Steinberger from UC Davis is originally from Switzerland. This prompted
Sinai Robins to immediately ask: "... doesn't he owe us money? ...". <br>
<br>
Another wonderful development was the decision by Sinai, Izabella and I
to launch a new journal named EJAC- Electronic Journal of Analytic
Combinatorics. Our plan is to initially run it as a web based journal
from Mizzou, and then sign up with a publisher. It was pointed out that
once the journal goes off-line, it will go from EJAC to JAC-OFF... We
will have to see what happens. <br>
<br>
Julia and I decided to write an undergraduate textbook on the Erdos
distance problem. It will be partly based on the notes we are currently
writing for the Mizzou summer program for high school students the two
of us are running in August. I am really excited about this project.<br>

The trip to Kansas State was quite amusing in many ways, though the
drive was hopelessly boring. It takes about three hours and fifteen
minutes to get there, no matter how much you speed. If the traffic in
KC does not get you, something else will. <br>
<br>
The Department of Mathematics at KSU is a remarkably quiet place. I saw
a total of about fifteen people during my stay, including the people I
ran into in the hallways. Before my colloquium talk I had a very nice
buffet style lunch with Andrew Bennett, Robert Burckel, Marianne
Korten, Pietro Poggi-Corradini, and Dimitry Ryabogin. The discussion
was mostly about politics of various sort, culminating in a discussion
of PBS, the Middle East, and <a
 href="http://www.wymaninstitute.org/articles/2004-denialreport.php">President
Abbas' holocaust denying
doctoral dissertation in Moscow</a>. <br>
<br>
The colloquium talk seems to have gone well. I talked mostly about the
relationship between the Falconer and Erdos distance conjectures, the
Erdos integer distance principle, and applications to analysis. Robert
Burckel, Marianne Korten, and Pietro Poggi-Corradini asked some
interesting questions and I felt that the most of the audience was
paying attention at least to some extent. <br>
<br>
The colloquium dinner later that evening was very very nice. Marianne
Korten, her daughter, a friend, Robert Burckel and Dimitry Ryabogin
took me to a very nice local restaurant specializing in cuisine of
uncertain origin. I had a clam chowder followed by steak, accompanied
by several beers from a local brewery. The discussion was much more
tame
this time around, mostly about my April 1 pranks and similar
activities. After dinner I went straight to sleep as I was extremely
tired. A great visit though! <br>
<br>
The following morning I had lunch with Dimitry and drove back to
Columbia, listening to Beethoven's sonatas over and over. I played the
Pathetique at several recitals when I was in high school and developed
and intense emotional relationship with the piece. I can literally
listen to it four or five times in a row and be equally excited each
time. <br>
<br>
My next trip is probably to New York City on May 17 to speak at the
conference in honor of Mel Nathanson's 60th birthday. I especially look
forward to Korean BBQ, and, of course, to playing basketball in Mel's
back yard! </p>

I am going to Manhattan, Kansas (little apple) in a few days to give a
colloquium talk. <br>
