          <br>
          One of the most beautiful ideas generated by modern science in
          the past few decades is the concept of neural nets, a
          computational framework that imitates the workings of the
          human brain. These networks have been used to understand the
          outcome of scientific experiments, make weather prediction and
          political forecasts and even aid mathematical research. In
          this program, we are going to take a comprehensive approach to
          neural nets, with focus on both the theoretical and applied
          aspects of this beautiful emerging discipline. To this end, we
          are going to develop the basic theory of neural nets in the
          mornings, followed by intensive programming sessions in the
          afternoons. We are looking for participants who are equally
          excited about the pure and applied aspects of data science-
          those who are just as willing to delve into the mathematical
          intricacies as they are to write complex code to implement the
          resulting ideas. <br>
          <br>
          The program is particularly focused on recruiting participants
          who are women and members of underrepresented groups. <br>
          <br>
          In addition to the research aspects, the program will also
          have an outreach component. A small group of middle school
          students from the inner city Rochester schools will be exposed
          to mathematical explorations using python. The participants in
          the program will be asked to assist in this wonderful and
          rewarding process. <br>

          <b>Structure of the TRIPODS REU program: <br>
            <br>
          </b>The Tripods REU program is conducted under the auspices of
          the <a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1934962&amp;HistoricalAwards=false">Tripods





















            NSF grant.</a> The Principal Investigator at the University
          of Rochester is <a
            href="https://www.hajim.rochester.edu/ece/people/faculty/cetin_mujdat/">Mujdat




















            Cetin</a>, and the Principal Investigator at Cornell is <a
href="https://stat.cornell.edu/people/faculty/david-s-matteson">David
            Matteson</a>.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          The basic structure of the REU is the following. The
          participants are going to be selected in the last week of
          February 2022. They will be asked to learn the background
          material prior to the start of the program. To this end, they
          will be provided with notes, videos and computer code that
          will give them the necessary skills for the research phase of
          the program. Regular (hybrid) meetings will be held starting
          in March 2022, to reinforce the material. Early in May 2022,
          the participants will be given a description of the research
          projects, and they will be asked to make a preliminary
          selection within a few weeks, at which point they will begin
          hybrid meetings with their research group. The composition of
          the research groups will remain in flux until the first few
          days of the program in July 2022, to give the participants an
          opportunity to explore several different groups and get a
          better feel for the projects.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          The program is going to run for four weeks, July 18-August 12,
          2022. The program will run in person in Rochester, NY.&nbsp;
          Fifteen (15) Tripods NSF participants will be accepted and
          each is going to receive a $1600 stipend for successfully
          completing the program. The application procedure is described
          below. The application deadline is February 21, 2022. <br>
          <br>
          Once the preliminary phase of the program starts in late
          April, 2022, after the selection process is finalized, a
          variety of study materials will be placed on the following

          <b>Structure of the STEM FOR ALL 2022 program: <br>
            <br>
          </b>Several mini-courses in a variety of areas of mathematics
          are going to run July 18-August 12, 2022. These will be
          announced in the coming weeks and months. Each mini-course is
          going to focus on computational aspects of one or more of the
          advanced undergraduate courses at the University of Rochester.
          A broader question that is going to be asked is, how can
          modern data science techniques contribute to the understanding
          of a given set of concepts in mathematics, and vice-versa. A
          limited amount of financial support for STEM FOR ALL 2022
          participants has been secured from University of Rochester. If
          you need financial support to participate in the program,
          please indicate this in your application.&nbsp; <br>
