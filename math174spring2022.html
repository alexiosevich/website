    <b>Office Hours: </b>1-2 p.m. MW and by appointment <br>
    <b>Textbook:</b> Calculus on manifolds, by Spivak <br>
    <b>Grading: </b>Homework (%20), In-class midterm (%25), Take-home
    project (%20), and Final (%35). <br>
    <b><br>
      Structure of the class: </b><br>
    <br>
    This is going to be a highly interactive class. I expect frequent
    in-class discussions designed to make sure that the material is
    absorbed in real time. Notes will be prepared and distributed ahead
    of time. <br>
    <br>
    <b>Structure of the exams and the final: </b><br>
    <br>
    The exams are designed to test both the knowledge of the proofs and
    the ability to apply the theoretical results in concrete instances.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Expectations:</b> <br>
    <br>
    The students will be expected to come to each class prepared. What
    this means is that on any given day, I expect the students to <i><u>know













        and understand</u></i> the proofs and examples that were covered
    in class up to that point. In addition, the students will be
    expected to read ahead and anticipate the material that is going to
    be covered. <br>
