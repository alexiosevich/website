 <span class="mainstory">The power of freedom, By Natan Sharansky</span><br>
 <span class="byline"></span><br>
  <span class="lead"> 
<p>Year after year, generation after generation, Jews spend Pessah night retelling
the story of their exodus from Egypt. </p>
 
<p>We try to instill in our children a sense of our ancient journey from
slavery to freedom and try to provoke discussion over its meaning. In fact,
our need to recall the past is so strong that each of us is obligated to
imagine that he or she personally went forth from Egyptian bondage. </p>
 
<p>Why does our faith demand that we go to such great lengths to remember?
 I have long believed that implicit in this commandment is a deep understanding
 of human nature. </p>
 
<p>Mankind easily forgets the meaning of the great events that have transformed 
it. We must constantly struggle to remind ourselves of the forces that have 
truly shaped our destiny. For most of us, appreciating one of those forces 
  the power of freedom   requires nothing less than an Herculean effort. 
</p>
 
<p>In 1974, at the age of 26, I participated in my first Seder with a group 
of Jewish activists in the Soviet Union. Though we knew little about that 
night's rituals, identifying with the seminal story of freedom's triumph
was not particularly difficult for us   especially with KGB agents waiting
in a car downstairs. </p>
 
<p>The 10th plague   the slaying of the first born   which challenged each 
Jew to decide whether to smear the blood of the false Egyptian god on his 
doorpost, was another idea to which every refusenik could relate. By publicly 
declaring our desire to emigrate to Israel, each of us had chosen to challenge 
the Soviet god and stand up against tyranny. The same yearning for freedom 
that once drove our people felt as if it was literally pulsing through our 
veins. </p>
 
<p>Some years later, I would have the opportunity to lead a Seder for the 
first time. In truth, my memory of the text of the Haggada was by then rather 
sketchy, and the Seder itself had none of the traditional trappings. There 
was no unleavened bread to eat, no bitter herbs to taste, no Haggada to read 
and I was the only Jew present. In fact, I was the only person in the room. 
But my outside "guests" didn't seem to mind. As I retold the story of Pessah 
through the small window of my punishment cell to two fellow inmates, they 
too could immediately identify with its universal message. </p>
 
<p>The reason was simple. This isolated group of dissidents in the Soviet
 Union had already experienced the power of freedom to transform an individual
 and understood its power to transform a society. They needed no reminders.
 The idea that a nation of slaves could win its freedom and defeat the most
 powerful empire in the world was to us not an ancient legend, but an eternal
 truth.<br>
 We knew that missiles, planes and tanks were in the end no match for the 
inner strength of people willing to resist tyranny. We also understood the 
undeniable logic in one of our fellow dissident's prediction that the arms 
of a state that always had to point a gun at its own subjects would eventually 
tire. To us, the collapse of the Soviet Union was as inevitable as freedom's 
march was inexorable. </p>
 
<p>SUCH THINKING was extremely rare outside the Gulag. Western policymakers
 had largely forgotten the power of freedom. To them, sentiments about the
 triumph of liberty may have been inspiring, but they were hardly practical.
 Like a Pessah tale that was nice to read but which no "serious" person would
 believe, most paid homage to the values of a free society but dismissed
as  hopelessly na ve the notion of an imploding evil empire. </p>
 
<p>Instead, these skeptics preferred a more "realistic" approach. D tente, 
and its various policy offshoots, was the product of such realism, and opposition 
to it, whether it came from the likes of a senator Jackson or a president 
Reagan, was considered reckless, if not dangerous.<br>
 But history would show that the so-called "realists" were completely divorced
 from reality. Their failure to appreciate the awesome power of freedom blinded
 them to the inevitable collapse of the Soviet superpower. They were the
ones  exposed as hopelessly out of touch, and the so-called dreamers proved
astute  pragmatists. </p>
 
<p>More than a decade later, after hundreds of millions have been liberated,
 many have again forgotten the power of freedom to change the world. Promoting
 democracy among the Arabs, as a few have boldly called for, is again cast
 as na ve adventurism. The Arabs, we are told, have never lived under democracy.
 Their culture and religion, we are assured, are inimical to the idea of
liberty.  </p>
 
<p>The realists dangle the "pragmatic" alternatives before us: Cut a deal 
with "friendly" dictators. They will fight terror. They will preserve order. 
They will make peace. </p>
 
<p>For the past 10 years, Israelis have witnessed the horrific consequences
 of this type of realism. Rather than place its faith in the power of Palestinian
 democracy, Oslo placed its faith in the power of Yasser Arafat's dictatorship.
 Arafat, we were told, was a man with whom we could do business. We would
give him unlimited power and in turn he would protect us from terror and
make peace with the Jewish State. </p>
 
<p>Even today, after Arafat's 30-month terror war against Israel and 10-year 
reign of terror over the Palestinians, the lessons have not been learned. 
Again, the rush to create a Palestinian State with "a man we can deal with" 
  before Palestinian democracy has a chance to take root   is in full swing. 
And again, it is being sold as the product of hard-headed realism. </p>
 
<p>IN SHARP contrast to this latest turn of events, last summer the power 
of freedom was remembered. In his historic speech, President Bush articulated
 a vision that Andrei Sakharov always championed: Only a country that respects
 the rights of its citizens will respect the rights of its neighbors. If
the  Palestinians were to build a society that protected individual freedom,
President  Bush promised that America would support the Palestinians' legitimate
yearning  for self-determination. It was not only the most noble vision of
peace this  region has ever heard, but also the first realistic one. </p>
 
<p>But predictably, the president's ideas were received by those who have 
forgotten the power of freedom as "na ve" and "impractical." Democracy, the 
critics argued, is nice in theory, but pragmatism demanded a different course 
be pursued. In London, in Paris, in Moscow and even in most quarters in Washington 
and Jerusalem, the skepticism took a familiar form: nice dream, but let's 
get back to reality. </p>
 
<p>Alas, if the fall of the evil empire couldn't change these skeptical minds, 
it is doubtful that the celebrations erupting in Baghdad will. There will 
be more excuses, more cynicism, and more hesitation. </p>
 
<p>But now it's the turn of Iraqis to experience the overwhelming power of 
freedom. Men and women who have lived for decades under tyranny will soon
 know, perhaps for the first time, what it is like to live without fear.
The  challenge for America and its allies will be to convince them that they
need  not live in fear again. </p>
 
<p>More importantly, the leaders of the free world will have to convince
themselves that tyranny is no more inherent to the Arab condition than it
is to the human condition. To ensure that the institutions needed to preserve
and protect liberty in Iraq are given the chance to develop, these leaders
must once again believe in the power of freedom. </p>
 
<p>The effect this freedom will have on the region is sure to be breathtaking.
 It will prove as contagious in the Middle East as it was in the Soviet Union.
 Soon, Iranians, Saudis, Syrians, Egyptians, Palestinians, and all who live
 in fear will envy those who no longer do. And they will increasingly find
 the courage to stand up and say so. </p>
 
<p>For those living under the blanket of liberty, the power of freedom is 
often forgotten. Tonight, Jews will be able to remind themselves of that
power, as we have been able to do for three thousand years. </p>
 
<p>When I read of our triumph over an ancient empire, I will surely recall 
our triumph over a modern one. And I will know in my heart that the dream 
for peace and stability in the Middle East will only be realized when we stop
believing that the power of freedom is only a legend. </p>
