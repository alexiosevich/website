          The goal of Grad Stem For All is to empower and further
          inspire all interested students from colleges and universities
          in Western New York area to pursue advanced degrees in STEM
          fields, particularly mathematics and statistics. We are
          especially looking to involve groups that have traditionally
          been underrepresented in STEM, including women and
          underrepresented minorities. Our goal is to provide these
          students with the information, skills and training needed to
          succeed in graduate school, academic careers, and industry.
          The two components of the program are coursework and
          mentoring. During the summer, faculty from local universities
          will be teaching a series of mini-courses that will enhance
          the undergraduate education the students receive at their
          liberal arts institution. These mini-courses are meant to be a
          preview of graduate coursework and provide students with a
          deeper background in mathematics and/or statistics. Each
          student participant will also be paired with an experienced
          faculty mentor from an area college or university, who can
          provide support and guidance throughout the student's college
          career and beyond. By having an identified mentor, students
          will more readily be able to get involved in research
          projects, learn about graduate schools, get advice on the
          application process, and learn more about life in academia in
          general. We intend for the mentor/student relationship to be
          long lasting, inspiring students to pursue advanced coursework
          and careers in STEM field. <br>

          graduate students from these departments. We hope to expand
          this list to cover every college and university in the
          Rochester area that teaches mathematics and statistics
          courses. <br>
          <br>
          <u><big><b>Mentoring: </b></big></u>Every participant in our
          program will be assigned to a mentor, who will assist them
          with course selection, advise them on additional readings and
          help them seek out graduate and professional opportunities.
          The participant will be able to maintain phone and email
          contact with the mentor, in addition to regular meetings. <br>
          <br>
          <u><b><big>Mini-courses:</big></b></u> The first wave of
          summer courses will be offered in June, 2018. Students will be
          responsible for their housing and transportation to the
          program. Each mini-course will run Monday through Friday for a
          two-week period. One mathematics and one statistics min-course
          will be offered June 4-15, and a second mathematics and
          statistics mini-course will be offered June 18-29. The formal
          coursework for each min-course will be concentrated in the
          mornings, with the afternoons dedicated to mentoring
          activities and small group problem solving. Each day will
          begin with a 45 minute lecture starting at 9 a.m., followed by
          a 30 minute discussion period. The second 45 minute lecture
          will begin at 10:15 a.m.., followed by another discussion
          period until noon. After lunch, a one hour problem solving
          session with graduate assistants will be followed by a
          mentoring session at 2 p.m.. We expect the wrap up each day's
          activities by 3.30 p.m.. A detailed description of the
          mini-courses follows below. <br>

          Title: <u><b>Introduction to functional programming with
              Haskell</b></u> <br>
          Prerequisites: Some programming experience and basic knowledge
          of logic and mathematical structures would be helpful.<br>
          <u><br>
            Description</u><u>:</u>&nbsp; The mini-course offers an
          introduction to the functional programming paradigm using
          Haskell as the programming language. We will cover the close
          connection between mathematical reasoning and the Haskell
          syntax. This leads to a clear implementation of mathematical
          concepts in a computer, and the possibility of applying logic
          and induction to the testing of correctness of computer
          programs. Along the way we will write many interesting
          programs, implement several algorithms, learn about higher
          order functions, algebraic and recursive data types and lazy
          evaluation. These methods will allow us to handle infinite
          data structures. <br>

          Title: <u><b>Bayesian inference with application to social
              network modeling</b></u><br>
          Prerequisites: Two semesters of calculus.<br>
          <br>
          <u>Description:</u> Social media is a prominent aspect of our
          society. Individuals are connected to each other and share
          relationships if it be via social media website or more
          traditionally through inter-personal friendships. It has thus
          become important to be able to model a social network and the
          relationships that exist between people. By representing the
          network with certain statistical properties, we can suggest
          new relationships, target marketing efforts, and understand
          the social trends that alter societal norms. <br>
          <br>
          In order to model such social network relationships, we must
          first develop an understanding of Bayesian inference. With the
          Bayesian approach to inferential methods, we use data to
          update parameter estimates. In doing so, we are able to
          incorporate new information and use this to readjust our
          understanding of model parameters. We will fully develop a
          foundation in Bayesian inference, discussing posterior
          distributions, conjugate priors, hierarchical models and a
          brief introduction to Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. We
          then end the course by framing current challenges in social
          network models within the Bayesian framework. <br>

          Title: <u><b>Optimization from the ground up</b></u> <br>
          Prerequisites: Two semesters of calculus.<br>
          <br>
          <u>Description:</u> In the first week we shall review the
          basic concepts of first and second year calculus. We shall
          then apply these concepts to basic optimization problem in one
          variable and then move on to their higher dimensional variants
          using Lagrange Multipliers. Towards the end of the first week
          we shall introduce some theoretical notions like continuity
          and convergence of functions. During the second week of the
          course we shall discuss more elaborate optimization problems
          like the iso-perimetric inequality, which says that the shape
          in the plane that has the largest area given a fixed perimeter
          is the disk. In the process we shall develop a variety of
          tools that will take us close to the cutting edge of this
          subject matter. <br>
