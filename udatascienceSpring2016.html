    The purpose of the seminar is to learn the basics of data science
    using the python programming language. During the second half of the
    semester we are going to design research projects related to the
    material under discussion. The seminar is going to meet on Wednesday
    evenings at 7.30 p.m. at a location to be determined. Undergraduate
    participants are encouraged to sign up for Math 395 in conjunction
    with participating in this seminar. <br>
