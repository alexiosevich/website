    <u><big><b>Style of advising:</b></big></u> My approach to each
    student depends on the student's individual needs and preferences. I
    typically meet with each student once a week, but I am willing and
    able to meet more often if the student requires extra help,
    especially early in the process. I prefer not to go for long periods
    of time without meeting with the student in order to make sure that
    things are running smoothly. Initially, I give most of my students a
    problem that I have thought through to a certain extent and believe
    it can be solved in a reasonable time frame. The second problem
    tends to be considerably harder, and so on. As the student
    progresses, they are expected to show more and more independence in
    the problem selection. When the student is close to graduating, I
    make an utmost effort to help them find a job, either in academia or
    industry, depending on the student's preferences. Some of my
    student's are co-advised with my colleagues, especially in cases
    when they work on problems involving several areas of mathematics.
    For example, I co-advised several students with Kaave Hosseini,
    Sevak Mkrtchyan, and Jonathan Pakianathan. <br>

    <u><big><b>Problems you can expect to work on:</b></big></u> I work
    on problems at the sticking points of harmonic analysis,
    combinatorics, and number theory. I also work in theoretical and
    applied data science. If you want to work with me, there are four
    main options and some combinations thereof: <br>
    <br>
    <b>Uncertainty principles, signal recovery, spectral synthesis, and
      applications to data science: </b><br>
    <br>
    The basic question is, if a function from a d-dimensional module
    over the integer mod N is transmitted via its Fourier transform and
    some of the frequencies are unobserved, can we recover the origin
    signal (function) exactly, without any errors. In a seminar paper
    from 1989, Donoho and Stark proved that the answer is yes if the
    signal is sufficiently sparse and the number of missing frequencies
    is sufficiently small. The key tool is the uncertainty principle
    which has been improved in a variety of settings by Tao, Meshulam
    and Iosevich-Mayeli in a recent paper connecting signal recovery to
    restriction theory for the Fourier transform. This line of research
    has both pure and applied aspects and there are strong connections
    with Learning Theory. Pablo Bhowmik, Will Burstein, Shantanu
    Deodhar, Zhihe Li, Hari Nathan and Ella Yu, both current Ph.D.
    students at the University of Rochester, are currently working on
    these and related topics. <br>
    <br>
    <b>Harmonic analysis with an emphasis on configuration problems in
      geometric measure theory: </b><br>
    <br>
    The basic question is, how large does a set in Euclidean space (or a
    Riemannian manifold) need to be to ensure that it contains vertices
    of a geometric configuration such as an equilateral triangle, an
    angle of a given size, or a chain of a given length. A combination
    of Fourier analytic and combinatorial methods play an important
    role. The key problem in this area is the Falconer distance
    conjecture which says that if the Hausdorff dimension of a compact
    set is half the ambient dimension, then the Lebesgue measure of the
    set of pairwise distances is positive. <br>
    <br>
    Among the Ph.D. students who worked or are working with me in this
    area are Shengze Duan (current graduate student), Quy Pham (current
    graduate student), Donggeun Ryou (current graduate student), Brian
    McDonald (former graduate student and currently a postdoc at the
    University of Georgia), Alex McDonald (former graduate student and
    currently a postdoctoral researcher at Ohio State University), Nik
    Chatzikonstantinou (former Ph.D. student at UR and currently a
    postdoc in Okinawa), Bochen Liu (former Ph.D. student and currently
    an Associate Professor at Southern Chinese University), Steven
    Senger (Associate Professor at the University of Missouri), Belmiro
    da Silva (instructor at Rensselaer Polytechnic), Krystal Taylor
    (Associate Professor, Ohio State), Brianna Vick (Assistant Professor
    at Clayton State University).<br>
    <br>
    <b>Distribution of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian on Riemannian
      manifolds, the Weyl Law, and the Uncertainty Principle: <br>
      <br>
    </b>In the past couple of years, I have been studying the
    distribution of eigenvalues on product manifolds. The key question
    here is whether the remainder term in the classical Weyl Law can
    always be improved in the product setting. Emmett Wyman (a former
    postdoctoral researcher at the University of Rochester and currently
    an Assistant Professor at SUNY Binghampton) and I proved that this
    is indeed the case, with concrete exponents, in the case of the
    product of spheres. We are currently working on the general case and
    there are many potentially fruitful opportunities for graduate
    students interested in this subject matter. <br>
    <br>
    Azita Mayeli (CUNY), Emmett Wyman (Binghampton) and I recently
    proved a variety of Fourier Uncertainty Principle results on
    Riemannian manifolds. The basic question is, given <br>
    <br>
    <b>Configuration problems in vector spaces over finite fields or in
      modules over commutative rings: </b><br>
    <br>
    While there is some overlap between the techniques involved in the
    two disciplines, the problems in the finite field setting have a
    non-trivial arithmetic component which frequently gives the problems
    a distinct flavor. In this setting we ask how large a subset of the
    d-dimensional vector space over a finite field needs to be to ensure
    that it contains vertices of an equilateral simplex or another
    geometric structure. Another key question is the sum-product
    question which asks for the smallest possible size of minimum of the
    sum set and the product set of a subset of a given finite field. <br>
    <br>
    Among the Ph.D. students who worked with me in this area are Esen
    Aksoy (postdoctoral research at the University of Ankara), Philipp
    Birklbauer (working in industry), Jeremy Chapman (former graduate
    student and currently a Professor at the Lyons College), David
    Covert (former graduate student and current an Assistant Professor
    at the University of Missouri-St. Louis), Doowon Koh (Associate
    Professor at Chungbuk University), Alex McDonald (postdoc at Ohio
    State), Brendan Murphy (former graduate student and currently a
    postdoctoral researcher at the University of Bristol), Steven Senger
    (Associate Professor at Missouri State University), Le Anh Vinh
    (Professor at the University of Hanoi). <br>
    <br>
    <b>The Erdos distance conjecture and related problems: </b><br>
    <br>
    This problem asks for the minimal number of the pairwise distances
    determined by the elements of a finite subset of a d-dimensional
    vector space over the real numbers. This conjecture was resolved in
    two dimension in 2011 by Larry Guth and Nets Katz, but the higher
    dimensional case remains wide open. The sum-product phenomenon
    described above is very much alive and well in this setting as well.
    <br>
    <br>
    Among the Ph.D. students who worked&nbsp; or are working with me in
    this area are Steven Senger (Associate Professor at Missouri State),
    Jonathan Passant (Heilbronn postdoc at the University of Bristol)
    and Firdavs Rakhmonov (current Ph.D. student at UR). <br>
    <br>
    <b>Data science and connections with geometric combinatorics: </b><br>
    <br>
    Last, but not least, there is also an option of working with me on
    problems in data science, ranging from completely applied to
    theoretical. I also work on applying some ideas from Learning
    Theory, the theoretical framework behind Data science, to analysis
    and combinatorics. In the applied data science realm, I am working
    on concrete sampling bounds for time series that would guarantee,
    with high probability, a forecast for a given time series can be
    given with high probability. I have also co-authored a series of
    paper recently studying the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension (one the
    key concepts of Learning Theory) of families of indicator functions
    of spheres centered at point of subsets of a given size of vector
    spaces over finite fields. This yields an interesting new angle on
    the finite field configuration problems mentioned above. Among the
    graduate students who have worked in this direction are Brian
    McDonald (a former graduate student and currently a postdoctoral
    researcher at the University of Georgia), Shashank Chorge (former
    graduate student and currently a postdoctoral research at IIT,
    India), and Pablo Bhowmick (current graduate student). <br>
