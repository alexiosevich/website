We agreed that I should write a draft summarizingour discussion and than pass it on to the rest of the group. A roughtdescription of the ideas is the following: <br><br>(1) Formation of the committee responsible for collecting informationabout highly performing first and second year students and channelingthem the mathematics club and/or appropriate mentors. <br><br>(2) Institution of Math 2980, a lower division version of Math 4980,designed to bring together and enhance the material learned in CalculusI, II and III in a problem solving format.&nbsp; <br><br><br></body></html>
