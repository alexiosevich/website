<p>The events of the past 11 months in Israel have been remarkably clarifying. 
When the Palestinians, on the pretext of a visit by Ariel Sharon to Jerusalem's 
Temple Mount, began the second intifada last fall, it was still possible for
the aggressively delusional to pretend that the Israelis and the Palestinians 
equally desired a workable peace. </p>
<p>That belief shattered under repeated, murderous attacks on Israelis that
clearly occurred with at least the tacit blessing of the Palestinian leadership.
</p>
<p>Now the other great founding myth of the peace process is also dead. This
is the great falsehood of relative morality. </p>
<p>For decades, the European left has maintained that the Palestinians held
a morally superior position to the Israelis: They were an illegally subjugated
people who were striking back in what may have been violent but were also
appropriate ways. </p>
<p>The claim of Palestinian moral superiority ended when the world saw Palestinians
cheer in the street a young man holding up hands red with the blood of an
Israeli soldier beaten to death, or perhaps it was when Palestinians stomped
two boys, one a US citizen, to death in a cave, or perhaps it was some other
moment of gross and gleeful murder. </p>
<p>What remained   the Left's final feeble resort   was a claim of moral equivalency:
The Palestinians might be engaged in terrible acts, but so too were the Israelis.
Both sides were killing; indeed, the Israelis, with their better arms and
soldiers, had killed far more than had the Palestinians. </p>
<p>Now this too has gasped its last breath. It is not possible to pretend 
any more that there is anything like a moral equivalency at work in this conflict.
The facts are indisputable. </p>
<p>ONE: The Palestinians are the aggressor; they started the conflict, and
they purposely drive it forward with fresh killing on almost a daily basis.
</p>
<p>Two: The Palestinians regard this second intifada not as a sporadically 
violent protest movement but as a war, with the clear strategic aim of forcing 
a scared and emotionally exhausted Israel to surrender on terms that would 
threaten Israel's viability. </p>
<p>Three: As a tactic in this strategy, the Palestinians will not fight Israeli
forces directly but instead have concentrated their efforts on murdering Israeli
civilians. The greater the number, the more pathetically vulnerable the victims
  disco-goers, women and children in a pizza restaurant   the better. </p>
<p>Four: Israel has acted defensively in this conflict; and while Israeli 
forces accidentally killed Palestinian civilians, their planned lethal attacks 
have all been aimed only at Palestinian military and terror-group leaders.
 </p>
<p>Since the Oslo accords were signed in 1993, Palestinian terrorists have
killed more than 400 Israelis. In June a bomber killed 21 teenagers at a
Tel Aviv disco; last week, a bomber killed 15 and maimed as many as a hundred
in a Sbarro pizzeria in Jerusalem; three days later, another suicide-bomber 
wounded 20 persons at another restaurant. </p>
<p>After the Sbarro bombing, Secretary of State Colin Powell, astonishingly, 
lectured the Israelis in the language of the literally exploded idea of moral 
equivalency. </p>
<p>"I hope that both sides will act with restraint," Powell said. "They both
have to do everything they can to restrain the violence, restrain the provocation
and the counter-response to the provocation." </p>
<p>This official US policy statement is beyond stupid. It is immoral, hypocritical,
obscene. It is indefensible. </p>
<p>Israel is at war with an enemy that declines, in its shrewdness and its
cowardice, to fight Israel's soldiers but is instead murdering its civilians, 
its women and children. This enemy promises, credibly, more murders. </p>
<p>In the face of this, in the aftermath of an attack expressly and successfully
designed to blow children to bits, how dare a smug, safe-in-his-bed American
secretary of state urge "restraint" by "both sides"? How does the secretary
imagine his own country would respond to such a "provocation" as the Sbarro
mass murder? (His own country bombed Serbia to its knees for killing ethnic
Albanians in distant Kosovo, let alone Americans on American soil.)  </p>
<p>And when you get down to it, why, exactly, should Israel continue to exercise
restraint? Why shouldn't it go right ahead and escalate the violence? The
only point to waging war is to win. </p>
<p>Israel is at war, and losing. It can win only by fighting the war on its
terms, unleashing an overwhelming force (gosh, just what is called for in
the Powell Doctrine) to destroy, kill, capture and expel the armed Palestinian
forces that have declared war on Israel. </p>
<p>So far, Israel has indeed chosen to practice restraint. But, at this point,
it has every moral right to abandon that policy and to engage in the war
on terms more advantageous to military victory. </p>
<p>This is a matter for Israel, at war, to decide one way or the other. Whether
Secretary Powell purses his lips or not.<br>
