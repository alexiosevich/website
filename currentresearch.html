      <div style="text-align: left;">I am currently interested in the
        following types of problems and connections among them. There is
        a need
        for the obvious disclaimer that breaking these problems up into
        different categories in inherently artificial and is being done
        solely
        for the purposes of exposition. I should also mention that while
        classical analysis problems like bounds for maximal operators,
        Lp-improving measures, estimates for oscillatory integrals are
        not
        explicitly listed below, they appear, directly or indirectly, in
        most
        if not all of the papers listed below. Even in the discrete
        context,
        Fourier analysis is always lurking, however subtly. <br>

        <br>
        The following are my recent papers in this research direction.
        The
        first ([GGIP]), second ([IMP]) and the fourth ([GI]) listed
        papers
        involve the application of multi-linear estimates to geometric
        problems. An interested reader who wishes to understand the
        method may
        want to start with the fourth listed paper, co-authored with
        Allan
        Greenleaf. The most general of these publications is the first
        listed
        paper where an attempt for comprehensive treatment of the
        subject. <br>
        <br>
        The third listed paper ([EHI]) uses projection estimate to
        obtain
        result for finite point configurations in fractal subset of the
        Euclidean space. Some, but not all of the exponents in this
        paper are
        improved in the first listed publication ([GGIP]). The reader
        may wish
        to compare and contrast the methods used. <br>
        <br>
        The fifth listed paper studies the distribution of volumes
        determined
        by d points and the origin in fractal subsets of the
        d-dimensional
        Euclidean space. The complication here is that the problem is
        not
        translation invariant. In the translation invariant setting,
        where
        volumes are determined by d+1 points in d-dmensional space, good
        exponents are obtained in the first listed publication ([GGIP]).
        <br>
        <br>
        The sixth and seventh listed publications are strongly related
        on the
        level of techniques. In ([IMS]) we prove that fractal subsets of
        sufficiently lage Hausdorff dimension determine a positive
        proportion
        of all possible directions. In ([IMT]) we give a simple and a
        natural
        extension of the result due to Mattila and Sjolin which shows
        that if
        the sum of Hausdorff dimensions of two subsets of d-dimensional
        Euclidean space exceeds d+1, then the set of distances from one
        set to
        the other contains an interval. <br>

        <br>
        This subject matter is closely related to the one above, with
        significant overlap in techniques. The first, second, third and
        fourth
        papers above can easily be listed in this category. An
        interested
        reader is encouraged
        to think about precisely which Euclidean techniques fail in the
        discrete and finite field settings, and vice versa. The
        following are
        my recent papers in this direction. All of these papers, in one
        form or
        another, deal with Erdos type problems in vector spaces over
        real
        number or over finite fields. The first ([IRZ]) and third
        ([IRR])
        papers deal with areas of triangles determined by subsets of
        planes
        over real numbers and finite fields, respectively. The former
        proves a
        finite field variant of the celebrated Beck lemma, whereas the
        second
        uses the Elekes-Sharir paradigma and Guth-Katz incidence theory
        to
        prove a sharp result about areas of triangles in the Euclidean
        plane. <br>
        <br>
        The second ([CIP]), sixth ([CEHIK]), eighth ([CHIKR]), ninth
        ([HIKR]),
        tenth ([IRU]), eleventh ([IH1]), twelfth ([IH2]), fourteenth
        ([IK]) and
        fifteenth ([IR]) papers deal with finite point configurations in
        vector
        spaces over finite fields, up to congruence. An interested
        reader is
        encouraged to read the last listed paper ([IR]) first as it is
        the one
        that started it all and gives a clear idea of the initial ideas
        that
        were further developed in subsequent papers. <br>
        <br>
        The fourth listed paper gives a simple description of directions
        determined by subsets of vector spaces over finite fields using
        both a
        Fourier analytic and algebraic arguments. This paper can be
        viewed as a
        finite field analog of ([IMS]) above. <br>
        <br>
        The fifth listed paper provides a series of connections between
        discrete, continuous and lattice points problems. In particular,
        the
        sharpness of the classical Falconer estimate from geometric
        measure
        theory is proved in higher dimensions using an arithmetic
        examples
        based on properties of paraboloids. It is based, in part, on a
        beautiful idea due to Pavel Valtr in the context of incidence
        theory. <br>
        <br>
        The tenth listed paper is a systematic study of the conversion
        mechanism, developed about ten years ago by Steve Hofmann,
        Izabella
        Laba, Misha Rudnev and I (see ([HI], [IL], [IR2] below) in a
        variety of
        contexts. The idea is to start out with an
        analytic estimate and deduce an incidence type result for
        discrete
        point sets. Some interesting complications arise, many of which
        are
        still wide open. <br>
        <br>
        The thirteenth listed paper provides the first known
        quantitative bound
        for sums and products in finite fields. Kloosterman sum
        technology is
        used to obtain these quantitative bounds. The bounds have since
        been
        improved and extended in variety of contexts by many authors. <br>
        <br>
        The seventh listed paper ([IJL]) shows that one can obtain a
        non-trivial incidence theorem for any homogeneous point set and
        a
        family of surfaces, provided that the associated operator
        satisfying
        non-trivial Sobolev bounds. This is still a largely unexplored
        frontier
        and I expect much work in this direction in the coming years. <br>

        <big style="font-weight: bold;">(3) Distribution of lattice
          points in
          convex domains and irregularity of distribution.</big><br>
        <br>
        One of the most beautiful problems in mathematics, in my view,
        is the
        question of counting lattice points inside a large dilate of a
        convex
        domain. The Gauss Circle Problem asks for the best possible
        estimate on
        the difference between the number of lattice points inside the
        disk of
        radius R in the plane and its area. Related questions also keep
        popping
        up in harmonic analysis, mathematical physics, geometric measure
        theory, geometric combinatorics and many other areas of
        mathematics.
        Irregularity of distribution, which deals with similar questions
        for
        general point sets has a time honored history going back to the
        pioneering work of Klaus Roth in the 50s and even further. <br>
        <br>
        The third ([ISS2]), fourth ([ISS1]), fifth ([BHI]) and sixth
        ([BIT])
        listed papers are on fairly classical results where the error
        term in
        the lattice point expansion is averaged in some fashion, either
        by
        rotating the domain or by dilating the stretching parameter. The
        second
        listed publication ([IKo1]) is a discrepancy problem for the
        needle on
        the checkerboard. In the first listed paper ([IT]), Fourier
        integral
        operator technology is applied to obtain results on the number
        of
        lattice points in thin annuli near families of manifolds in
        Euclidean
        space. Non-isotropic dilations are also addressed, with
        connections to
        parabolic examples in geometric combinatorics, as in ([IS])
        above. <br>

        <br>
        The subject area that I keep on coming back to over the past
        fifteen
        years or so is the field of exponential bases and frames.
        Connections
        between the existence of frames and tiling, while disproved in
        general
        by Tao, Kolountzakis and Matolci, continues to be an intriguing
        concept, and connections with combinatorial Erdos problems keep
        on
        arising in new and unexpected ways. <br>
        <br>
        The seventh ([IKP]) and eighth ([IKT1]) listed papers show that
        if a
        domain has the point of curvature on the boundary, then the L2
        space of
        this domain does not possess an orthogonal basis of
        exponentials. In
        fact, ([IKP]) provides a connection between the problem of the
        existence of the exponential bases with the Erdos distance
        problem in
        geometric combinatorics. The ninth listed paper ([IKT2]) proves
        the
        Fuglede conjecture for convex planar domains, namely that the L2
        of the
        domain has an orthogonal basis of exponentials if and only if
        the
        domain tiles the plane by translation. While the Fuglede
        conjecture has
        in general been disproved, as we mention above, it does hold for
        convex
        domains in the plane and, most likely, in my view, in higher
        dimensions
        as well. <br>
        <br>
        The first two listed papers deal with the question of how many
        orthogonal exponentials exist in the L2 space of a domain with a
        smooth
        boundary and non-vanishing curvature. In the first listed paper
        ([IR3])
        we prove that if the dimension is not congruent to 1 mod 4, the
        number
        is finite. If the dimension is congruent to 1 mod 4, the number
        must be
        infinite, but the vectors generating the exponentials must lie
        on a
        line. In the second listed paper ([IKo2]), we prove, improving
        upon a
        previous result with Philippe Jaming, that in the disk of radius
        R, the
        number of such exponentials is at most CR^{2/3}. <br>
        <br>
        The fourth ([IKo3]) and the fifth ([IP1]) listed papers are
        dedicated
        to the understanding of the distribution of frames on domains in
        Euclidean space. Weyl type formulas are proved, with fractal
        geometry
        playing an interesting role. <br>
        <br>
        The sixth ([IP2]) paper, one of my favorite projects of all
        time, we
        prove that a set of vectors is a tiling set of the unit cube by
        translation if and only if this set generates the exponential
        basis for
        L2 space of the cube. This result was proved simultaneously, by
        different methods, by Lagarias, Reed and Wang. <br>
