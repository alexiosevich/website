program on the Besicovitch/Kakeya conjecture August 2004<br>

<p><font color="#000000">We ran a week long program in
combinatorial mathematics for high school students, August 9-13 M-F
1:00-4:00 p.m. in GCB 119. A
detailed <a
 href="http://www.math.missouri.edu/%7Eiosevich/kakeyahsflyer.html">description
of the program</a>
and
a <a href="http://www.math.missouri.edu/%7Eiosevich/registration.html">registration
form</a> is available at
these
links. An updated set of <a
 href="http://www.math.missouri.edu/%7Eiosevich/kakeyahs.pdf">lecture
notes</a>
is
available here in .pdf format. <br>
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">I also ran an accelerated version of this
program for advanced undergraduate and graduate students. This part of
the program will ran August 9-11, 7:00-9:00 p.m. in GCB 204. The
lecture notes are the same as the ones listed above
for the high school program, but we went through them much faster. <br>
</font></p>
<font color="#000000">I plan to run a version of the same program
this summer. Dates and format will be determined by the end of January.</font></div>
