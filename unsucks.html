The United Nations Human Rights Commission on Tuesday overwhelmingly condemned
Israel for "mass killing" of Palestinians, and for its settlement policy
in the Palestinian territories. <span class="lead">
<p>The United States was alone in voting against all four resolutions, saying
that the criticism of Israel was one-sided and unfair. </p>
<p>The resolutions followed impassioned arguments earlier in the commission's 
annual session during which Palestinian delegate Nabil Ramlawi claimed that 
Israel used forms of killings and torture which "were worse than the practices 
of Nazism." The comments caused outcry among Jewish groups. </p>
<p>Israel is regularly condemned by the 53-nation commission -- the top UN
human rights body -- which this year is chaired by Libyan ambassador Najat
Al-Hajjaji. In a report to the commission, UN special investigator John Dugard
criticized Israeli violations and said construction of a barrier separating
Israelis and Palestinians was illegal. </p>
<p>The commission passed by 50 votes to one a resolution put forward by European
countries which voiced "grave concern" at continuing Israeli settlement activities
"including the illegal installation of settlers in the occupied territories."
It criticized the restrictions on freedom of movement of Palestinians and
the so-called security wall, while also condemning "indiscriminate terrorist
attacks." </p>
<p>The United States voted against the motion. Australia and Costa Rica abstained.
Israel is not a member of the commission. </p>
<p>A tougher seven-page resolution sponsored by African and Arab nations criticized
"the gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law,
in particular, acts of extrajudicial killing, closures, collective punishments, 
the persistence in establishing settlements, arbitrary detentions, the besieging 
of Palestinian towns and villages, the shelling of Palestinian residential 
districts from warplanes, tanks and Israeli battleships, the conducting of 
incursions into towns and camps and the killing of men, women and children 
there." </p>
<p>It condemned the "acts of mass killing perpetrated by the Israeli occupying
authorities against the Palestinian people." </p>
<p>It was passed by 33 votes to 5, with Canada, Australia, Germany and Peru
joining the United States in opposition. There were 15 abstentions, mainly
from European nations. </p>
<p>US delegate Michael Southwick said the resolution failed to reflect the
reality of Palestinian suicide bombers and terrorism against innocent Israeli
men, women and children. </p>
<p>"Israel is not responsible for all the ills plaguing the people in the
region. Israel has the right to self-defense," Southwick said. </p>
<p>Canadian ambassador Christopher Westdal said the language of the text
was "unacceptable and often inflammatory." </p>
<p>Another resolution affirming the "inalienable, permanent and unqualified 
right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, including their right 
to establish their sovereign and independent Palestinian State," passed 51-1. 
The sole opposing vote was the United States'. </p>
<p>A final resolution called on Israel to desist from changing the physical 
character and legal status of the Syrian Golan Heights it occupied in the 
1967 war. That passed 31-1, with 21 abstentions.</p>
