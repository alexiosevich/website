    I met Steve Senger under hilarious circumstances. I substituted for
    the calculus class Steve Senger was taking as a first year
    undergraduate student at the University of Missouri. I walked in,
    wrote the letter "e" on the board, and asked the class what it is.
    Steve raised his hand and started telling me that it 2.7182... I
    interrupted Steve and told him that all it is is the fifth letter in
    the alphabet. I could see Steve mumbling "asshole" under his breath.
    This was a beginning of a friendship that lasted ever since! Steve
    was an engineering major throughout most of his undergraduate years
    and only towards the end I was able to convince him to apply to the
    Missouri graduate program in mathematics where he became my PH.D.
    student. <br>
    <br>
    Since then Steve and I have written numerous papers, visited each
    other frequently and shared joys and sorrows of life. Steve helped
    to shape my views on work-life balance that has influenced me
    considerably over the past two decades. <br>
