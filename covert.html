    David Covert is firmly associated in my mind with the tradition I
    started towards the end my tenure at the University of Missouri of
    working with my PH.D. students at the Lakota coffee shop. This is an
    absolutely wonderful place that always put a smile on my face when I
    walked in. I often spend hours and hours in there, ordering a
    bottomless cup of coffee and having a bagel and lox sandwich for
    lunch. David and I typically met at the back of the coffee shop near
    the giant coffee grinding machine and just worked on mathematics
    together. We started the investigation of volume sets defined over
    subsets of vector spaces over finite fields and developed methods
    that were later successfully transferred to the Euclidean setting in
    a series of papers with Allan Greenleaf and Mihalis Mourgoglou and
    also with Allan Greenleaf and Krystal Taylor. <br>

    David Covert always impressed me with a thorough and comprehensive
    nature of his approach to mathematics. This led him to write an
    absolutely wonderful geometric combinatorics text a few years ago
    that many of graduate and undergraduate students have used. He has
    also co-advised two PH.D. students at the University of Rochester
    while teaching a considerable load at the University of Missouri -
    St. Louis. <br>
