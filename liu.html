    Bochen Liu came to the University of Rochester with an excellent
    background in harmonic analysis and hit the ground running. He was
    an important contributor to the development of the group action
    formalism for the study of simplexes in subsets of Euclidean space
    of a given Hausdorff dimension. He later proved the celebtrated
    Bochen Liu lemma using group actions, the idea that had considerable
    impact on the study of the Falconer problem in a variety of
    settings. <br>
    <br>
    After graduating, Bochen did some outstanding work on tiling with
    Nir Lev in Israel, and then moved on to South China university where
    continues to make outstanding contributions in harmonic analysis and
    geometric measure theory. Among my many great memories of Bochen are
    the ping-pong games we played in the den of my house. I always
    suspected that Bochen let me win just enough games for me to feel
    good about my game! <br>
