Thebasic problem is the following. Let A be a finite subset of the ring R.Then either the sum-set A+A or the product set A*A is much bigger insize than A. This is not true, of course, in the generality it isstated, since $R$ could be a finite field and A a subfield, but, as weshall see, the principle holds in a wide variety of situations. <br></div></div></body></html>
