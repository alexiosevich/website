    This page is dedicated to my past and present Ph.D. students. I have
    been incredibly fortunate to have had the opportunity to advise so
    many wonderful students. Their accomplishments are due to their
    talents and effort. I am just happy to have had the opportunity to
    assist them within the confines of my limited abilities. <br>
    <br>
    I am in the process of creating a link for each graduate student
    containing a short description of how I met them or an interesting
    moment during their graduate studies. This will take a little while,
    but it will happen! <br>
