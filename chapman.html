    Jeremy Chapman is one of several of my students who was born and
    raised in Missouri. Jeremy was a big time athlete in high school and
    college and was probably only held back from a career in
    professional sports by a very serious injury. Jeremy is an avid
    hunter. The venison he brought me on a couple of occasions was
    absolutely spectacular and his description of bow and arrow hunting
    was interesting and captivating. <br>

    Jeremy Chapman became my student at a time when the develop of a
    variety of consequences of my paper with Misha Rudnev on the
    Falconer problem in vector spaces over finite fields was in full
    swing. The first part of his thesis was a sum product problem for
    two by two matrices over finite fields. This problem and its higher
    dimensional analogs fascinate me to this day. In the late 2023
    Jeremy and I started doing mathematics again and the topic that we
    chose was an analog of the Erdos Integer Distance Principle in
    vector spaces over finite fields. <br>
