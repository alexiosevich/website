        The purpose of this conference is to bring together senior and
        junior researchers working on continuous and discrete aspects of
        finite point configurations from analytic, discrete and ergodic
        points of view. The problems under consideration include
        Szemeredi's theorem on arithmetic progressions, Ziegler's result
        on point configurations inside sets of positive Lebesgue
        density, as well as recent progress on the Erdos and Falconer
        distance conjectures. The workshop will be conducted in a
        friendly and leisurely atmosphere, with no more than five
        lectures each day and plenty of time for informal discussion and
        collaboration. <br>
