        Iosevich (iosevich@math.rochester.edu) and Jonathan Pakianathan
        (jonpak@math.rochester.edu) with the assistance of Brendan
        Murphy and Qiaofeng Zhu. <br>
        <br>
        This summer, Jonathan Pakianathan and I are running an informal
        research program for Rochester undergraduate students on
        pseudo-random graphs. We shall begin by reading a seminal paper
        by Krivelevich and Sudakov, enclosed below. We shall then
        examine a variety of graphs that came up in our recent
        investigations of Erdos type problems in vector spaces over
        finite fields. Connections between pseudo-random graphs and
        topics in data science are also going to be explored. <br>
        <br>
        We are going to meet twice a week, on Tuesdays and Wednesdays,
        2-4 p.m.. During the first two weeks, we are also going to meet
        on Mondays in order to accelerate the learning of the background
        material. The first couple of lectures will be dedicated to the
        basic facts about graphs. The next couple of lectures will deal
        with random graphs. Once we have this background under control,
        we shall go through the paper by Krivelevich and Sudakov and
        then move on to applications. <br>
        <br>
        For some background on basic graph theory you can take a look at
        a variety of texts and lecture notes. A particularly nice recent
        set of notes is by Benny Sudakov, enclosed below. To get a nice
        introduction to the theory of random graphs, the participants
        are encouraged to take a look at the original paper by Erdos and
        Renyi where this notion was first introduced. <br>

        <big><b>Rough plan</b></big>: To paraphrase Mike Tyson, a former
        boxing champion, everybody has a plan until they get smacked in
        the nose. Nevertheless, here is a rough plan for the next few
        weeks. We are going to begin by going over basic graph theory,
        along the lines of Benny Sudakov's notes enclosed above, with a
        few wrinkles thrown in. We shall then give a quick crash course
        on elementary probability, along the lines of the last part of
        the second volume of Apostol's Calculus, followed by a gentle
        introduction to random graphs. Once we have these notions under
        control, we shall move on to pseudo-random graphs, guided by the
        aforementioned paper by Krivelevich and Sudakov. In the research
        phase of the program, we are going to consider some naturally
        arising pseudo-random graphs that come from geometric
        combinatorial problems in vector spaces over finite fields. <br>
