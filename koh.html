    When Doowon Koh came from Korea to work with me at the University of
    Missouri, I immediately knew that he was an outstanding student. He
    was willing to read very difficult papers and always came to meeting
    prepared. What was wonderful and somewhat humorous was the contrast
    between him and Derrick Hart. If I sent a calculation to Derrick
    that was not correct, he would walk into my office and say something
    like: "Alex! The calculation is wrong!". Doowon approached such
    things very differently. He would usual say: "Professor Iosevich!
    How should formula in line 5 on page 7 of your draft be
    interprepeted?" What he mean was that line 5 was completely wrong.
    My usual reaction was to ask him how he "interprets" that line.
    Doowon would inevitably tell me that he "took the liberty of
    rephrasing" line 5 and hand me a new draft where everything was
    completely correct. <br>
    <br>
    One of the most amazing moments of my interaction with Doowon was on
    the day when he defended his thesis. This was the first time he
    called me by my first name instead of "Professor Iosevich". Our
    collaboration and friendship has continued to this day. <br>
