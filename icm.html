    The International Congress of Mathematics (ICM) is the premier venue
    for world class mathematicians from all major areas of mathematics
    to present their work. The first ICM was held in Chicago in 1983,
    featuring David Hilbert, Adolph Hurwitz,&nbsp; Felix Klein and
    Hermann Minkowski, along with many other luminaries of the late 19th
    century mathematics. Meetings were held roughly every four years
    since then, except for a 14 year gap from 1936-1950 due to the
    Second World War. The <a

    the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevanlinna_Prize">Nevanlinna
      Prize</a>, the <a

      Prize</a>, and the <a

    are awarded during the opening ceremony. For more detailed
    information about the International Congress of Mathematics and the
    complete list of speakers over the years, one can take a look at the

    The University of Rochester currently has two former ICM speakers on
    faculty: <a
      href="http://www.math.rochester.edu/people/faculty/doug/">Doug
      Ravenel</a> and <a
      href="http://www.math.rochester.edu/people/faculty/cohf/">Fred
      Cohen</a>. Professor Ravenel delivered a lecture, entitled "<a
href="http://www.mathunion.org/ICM/ICM1978.1/Main/icm1978.1.0491.0496.ocr.pdf">Complex
      cobordism and its applications to homotopy theory</a>" at the ICM
    held in Helsinki in 1978, in the Topology section. Professor Cohen
    gave a talk, entitled "<a
href="http://www.mathunion.org/ICM/ICM1983.1/Main/icm1983.1.0621.0626.ocr.pdf">Applications
      of loop spaces to classical homotopy theory</a>" at the 1983 ICM
    in Warsaw, also in Topology. <br>
