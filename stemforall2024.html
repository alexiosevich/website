    Welcome to StemForAll2024 summer workshop. All the interested
    University of Rochester students are welcome to participate. The
    registration process is only used to assign the students to suitable
    projects. The main idea behind the workshop is to share the research
    we are doing with undergraduate students for the purpose of
    familiarizing them with research methods and techniques. Quite often
    research papers result from these discussions, but the main emphasis
    is on learning and the creative process.<br>
    <br>
    <u><b>Organizers:</b></u> Alex Iosevich and Azita Mayeli <br>
    <br>
    <u><b>StemForAll2024 Workshop Instructional Team:</b></u> James
    Choe, Matthew Dannenberg, Gabe Hart, Alex Iosevich, Steven Kleene,
    Anuraag Kumar, Azita Mayeli, Svetlana Pack, Alice Quillen, Nathan
    Skerret, Stephanie Wang, and Nathan Whybra<br>

    <br>
    <u><b>Dates:</b></u> July 29 - August 9, 2024 <br>
    <br>
    <u><b>Structure of the workshop:</b></u> The workshop is going to
    consist of supervised research projects and series of lectures
    designed to help gain the necessary background as you are working on
    your projects. The exact topics of the lecture series will be
    determined in the coming weeks. The exact topics for the research
    projects will be selected based on your interests and preferences. <br>
    <br>
    This workshop is partly a culmination of undergraduate research
    activities that have transpired during the academic year. Once the
    workshop is over, the research projects are likely to continue into
    the Fall 2024 semester and beyond. <br>

    transmitted via its discrete Fourier transform and some of the
    signal is lost in the transmission due to noise or interference.
    Under what conditions is it possible to recover the original signal
    exactly? This innocent looking question quickly leads to some
    interesting techniques and ideas from analysis, combinatorics and
    other areas of mathematics. We are going to investigate these types
    of questions from both the theoretical and computational points of
    view. <br>

    <br>
    <b>Research meeting location:</b> 1011 Hylan <br>
    <b> </b><br>
    <b>Project description:</b> This project is continuing from last
    summer. The question is, which convex domain K in d-dimensional
    Euclidean space with a boundary with a fixed (d-1)-dimensional
    Hausorff content maximizes the Buffon probability? Here the Buffon
    probability p(K,r) is the probability that if one end of a needle of
    length r lands in K with uniform probability, then the other end
    also lands in K. Last summer, William Hagerstrom, Gabriel Hart, Tran
    Duy Anh Le, Isaac Li, and Nathan Skerett essentially resolved this
    question in two dimensions. They proved that given any convex set K
    in the plane where the length of the boundary is equal to 2 pi,
    there exists a threshold r_0 such that if r&lt;r_0 and K is not the
    unit disk D, then p(K,r)&lt;p(D,r). The purpose of this year's
    project is to extend this result to higher dimensions. <br>

      Project description: </b>The Automated Theorem Proving (ATP)
    research group will focus on first understanding, then developing
    computer programs that can prove mathematical theorems
    automatically. We plan to tackle the first few chapters of
    "Introduction to Univalent Foundations of Mathematics," which
    introduces a new way of thinking about mathematics, emphasizing how
    objects are the same (or equivalent) rather than just focusing on
    their properties. The group's goal is to use computers to navigate
    and validate the theories and exercises in these chapters, helping
    to advance our understanding of how these foundational concepts can
    be applied and verified using technology. Coding will be done in
    Python, and use of ChatGPT is welcome and even encouraged so far as
    the programmer understands the code produced. <b><br>

    <b>Project description:</b> At present, the United States severely
    underperforms in mathematics relative to its global standing,
    leading to countless attempts to aid STEM students. Lesser studied,
    however, is pedagogy at the undergraduate level, and the factors
    that go into attracting and retaining math major students. In this
    group, we will explore the variety of factors that contribute to the
    undergraduate mathematics experience through a first-generation
    lens, including, but not limited to: allocation of university
    resources, available mathematical support, community openness,
    perceived mathematical stigma and career trajectory, etc. Students
    in this group can expect to do mathematical modeling of demographics
    and statistical analysis, as well as learn how to apply quantitative
    measurements to subject data (interviews, surveys, etc.). Coding
    will be done in Python and/or R, and use of ChatGPT is welcome and
