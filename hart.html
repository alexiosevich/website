    I first met Derrick Hart when he was a student in my Putnam
    Preparation Class at the University of Missouri. I got to know him
    quite well and a couple of years later he went to Georgia Tech
    University to get his Ph.D. Due to family circumstances, Derrick
    came back to Missouri and got a Ph.D. under my direction. This led
    to a joint result with Derrick and Jozsef Solymosi on sum product
    product inequalities, followed by my joint work with Derrick on
    connections between sum-product inequalities and properties of
    discrete Radon transforms. These results generated techniques and
    ideas that continue to play an important role in my work to this
    day. <br>
    <br>
    After a postdoc at Rutgers and another at Kansas State, Derrick
    decided to go into industry for family reasons. Before his
    departure, he created a strong and influential body of work that
    continues to influence the field of geometric combinatorics. <br>
    <br>
    It is always wonderful to hear from Derrick and share stories and
    reminiscences. <br>
