    Philipp Birklbauer came to work with me from Austria where he was
    one of the best young computer programmers and mathematics students.
    Philipp's computer background came in very handy during the first
    part of his thesis when Philipp wrote a very efficient computer
    program to check the cases required to prove that the Fuglede
    Conjecture holds in three dimensional vector spaces over integers
    modulo seven. In the second half of his thesis, Philipp did some
    very nice work on the two-parameter variant of the Erdos distance
    problem in vector spaces over finite fields, and on the problem of
    distances from points to hyperplanes. <br>
    <br>
    Philipp was always interested in returning to computer programming
    and he is now working for Google where his combination of
    mathematical and programming skills work together very nicely. In
    addition to his mathematical and computer science prowess, Philipp
    is a very sensitive human being who cares deeply about many
    important social causes. <br>
