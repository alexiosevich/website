With another Passover, the world's Jews again find themselves at the center
of a firestorm of lies and distortions that threaten the lives of individuals
and, indeed, of the reborn ancient Jewish homeland of Eretz Israel. </font></font></font></p>

<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica"  size="3"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="3">I see world developments
of the past two years or so as the beginnings of a very dangerous new anti-Jewish
holocaust, predicated, as all previous anti-Jewish holocausts and pogroms
have been, on lies. </font></font></font></p>

<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica"  size="3"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="3">This time, however, I find
myself involved in some small way, as a newspaper columnist. </font></font></font></p>

<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica"  size="3"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="3">For many years, I wrote
a humor column for local and national markets, but since the terrorist attacks
of Sept. 11, 2001, I've been essentially unable to "think funny" very often.
I have, instead, written quite a lot about what I see as the serious global 
threat represented by the proponents of radical Islam, which have developed
a series of anti-Israel and anti-Jewish lies, and have sold them wholesale
to way too many willing buyers around the world. </font></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica"  size="3"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="3"> </font></font></font></p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica"  size="3"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="3">I realize that for a person
with easily injured feelings, mine is a dangerous position to take in a public
forum like a newspaper column. It is, after all, decidedly pro-Jewish and
pro-Israel, which means it's decidedly unpopular with most liberal thinkers,
one of which I have been all of my adult life. I'm not, in fact, sure when
it became right wing to support Israel and be  pro-Jewish, but it definitely
has, and this has thrown me out of my usual political orbit. </font></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica"  size="3"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="3"> </font></font></font></p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica"  size="3"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="3">However, I can't help feeling
that if someone doesn't speak the truth, those seeking to redirect history
by warping it, will succeed, and everyone will lose, including those who
either by design or deception, have adopted the lie as the truth. </font></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica"  size="3"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="3"> </font></font></font></p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica"  size="3"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="3">If I weren't an avid student
of history, I doubt it would be so troubling to me to allow anyone who wants
to believe the Big Lie to do so without my putting in my two cents. But I
know where that kind of intentional ignorance can lead, particularly for
Jews, and, being a Jew and the mother of Jewish sons, I find it difficult
not to at least try and shake some clarity into people.  </font></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica"  size="3"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="3"> </font></font></font></p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica"  size="3"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="3">What I guess I'm not accounting
for is some peoples' intense desire to ignore any fact that might paint the
Jews in a positive light. I'm not sure where that kind of selective blindness
comes from, but it isn't new, and has cost millions of Jewish lives throughout
history. </font></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica"  size="3"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="3"> </font></font></font></p>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica"  size="3"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="3">Most people, with the exception
of those truly deranged, neo-Nazi or radical Islamic element, agree that
those Big Lies that have gone out of control in the past, (the Jews kill
Christian babies to make matzo, or the Jews poisoned the wells to cause the
Plague, or the Jews have a direct line to Satan in their beards, or the Jews
are a crafty, subhuman race, too dangerous to allow to live) were, in fact,
Big Lies, and the resultant murder of millions of Jews, unfortunate. What
they fail to see is the latest round of anti-Jewish lies (like the Jews of
Europe stole Palestine from the Ancient Palestinians, they were behind the
terror attacks of 9-11, or they deliberately targeted civilians in the mythical
Massacre in Jenin), are of the same ilk, perpetrated by the same  kinds of
people with the same anti-Jewish agenda, and I don't feel safe just letting
it go, and waiting for people to apologize to the survivors later. So, I
guess I'll just have to tolerate the occasional hate mail. </font></font></font></p>

<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica"  size="3"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="3">For the past 50 years, Jews
at their Passover tables everywhere, have been able to say "Next year in
Jerusalem," and know such a thing is possible. Last year, one of hundreds
of contract suicide killings of Jews and Israelis, targeted dozens of innocent
civilians at their Passover Seder in Israel. No huge, worldwide outcry ensued.
They were only Jews, after all, and the world recognizes the Jew as victim.
It is less comfortable with the Jew as self-preserving warrior. </font></font></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica"  size="3"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="3">Here's hoping they get used
to it, and that the world's Jews will still be able to realistically pray
for Passover next year in Jerusalem.<nobr>     </nobr></font></font></font></p>
