   This page is dedicated to the legend of a young sturgeon. On Thursday, 
February  27, a group of Schrodinger Institute program on Combinatorial and 
Number theoretic methods in analysis converged upon a strange looking Russian 
restaurant in Vienna. The service was even stranger, as we soon discovered. 
Many aspects  of that evening could be considered note-worthy, but we shall 
concentrate  on the issue at hand. (A large number of photographs from that 
night will soon become available on my web page under the <a  href="friendsandfamily.html">Friends and Family</a> heading). Professor
Oskolkov ordered a sturgeon, a typical Russian dish. After a long wait, the
waiter unceremoniously dumped a plate of whitewish on the table and started
walking away. Oskolkov was understandbly perturbed and requested an explanation.
After a few minutes of "yes it is", "no it's not", "yes it is", "no it's
not", the waiter left to consult with the chef. A minute later, he emerged
with the explanation that the reason the fish does not look like a sturgeon,
is because it is a "very very young sturgeon"... Those who heard the exchange
nearly died laughing. Oskolkov then proposed that from now on, every false
theorem be called a "young sturgeon". Thus the legend of a young sturgeon
was born! <br>
  <br>
  We ask those with similar legends to send them to me. I will happily add
 those stories to this page. <br>
