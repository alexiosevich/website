    Dee Ethier was always an energetic and interesting person. Our first
    interesting encounter was when she asked me what grade she is
    getting in graduate analysis. When I replied by asking what grade
    she thinks she deserves, Dee said that she did not care! I have
    always liked this kind of an attitude and Dee and I got along very
    well throughout the thesis process. Dee chose to write her thesis on
    Erdos-Falconer type problems in the p-adic setting. The subtle
    interaction of analysis and number theory in that setting is truly
    interesting and Dee was able to produce a very nice series of
    results that helped to provide a bridge between the finite field
    setting and the corresponding problems in Euclidean space where the
    Hausdorff dimension is the typical measure of size. Dee chose to
    work in industry after her postdoc at the University of Maine, but
    she maintains keen interest in mathematics to this day. <br>
