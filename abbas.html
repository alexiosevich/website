 <span class="mainstory">Survivor Lantos wants to educate Abbas about Holocaust</span><br>
 <span class="byline"> By <a href="mailto:herb@jpost.co.il">HERB KEINON</a></span> 
<span class="lead"> 
<p>Tom Lantos, the only Holocaust survivor in the US Congress, told Palestinian 
Authority Prime Minister-designate Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) on Monday that 
he will guide him through Washington's Holocaust Museum when he comes calling. 
</p>
 
<p>Abbas wrote a doctoral thesis some 20 years ago for Moscow's Oriental
University denying that 6 million Jews were killed in the Holocaust, saying
the number was even fewer than a million. </p>
 
<p>Lantos (D-CA), the highest ranking Democrat on the International Relations 
Committee, was born in Budapest in 1928 and was 16 when the Nazis occupied 
Hungary. </p>
 
<p>He was a member of the anti-Nazi underground and later of the anti-Communist
 student movement. He arrived in the US in 1947 on an academic scholarship. 
 </p>
 
<p>"I am fully aware of his past record on the Holocaust," Lantos said when 
asked about Abbas's doctoral dissertation at a Jerusalem press conference. 
 </p>
 
<p>"As I was leaving [the meeting], I indicated that I would be his guide 
to the Holocaust&nbsp; Museum during his visit to Washington. I think he
needs considerable insight into what in fact happened in the Holocaust."
</p>
 
<p>Abbas, in his dissertation entitled "The Secret Relationship Between Nazism 
and Zionism," wrote that Hitler did not decide to exterminate the Jews until 
David Ben-Gurion provoked him into it by declaring war on the Nazis in 1942. 
He wrote that the 6 million number was a myth created by the Jews to force 
the world into accepting the establishment of Israel. He also argued that 
the gas chambers were not used to kill people, but to disinfect them, and 
the crematoria were used to burn bodies to prevent disease. </p>
 
<p>Abbas's dissertation was adapted into a book and published in Jordan in 
1984.</p>
