This project was originally sparkedby and continued to be inspired by a series of conversations I had overthe years with a former student,Shannon Reed. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Projected completion date</span>: Endof October/beginning of November 2006. <br><br><br><big style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Erdos distance problem</span></big>, withJulia Garibaldi <br><br>In this book we give a simple and thorough exposition of the knownresults pertaining to the Erdos distance problem in geometriccombinatorics. The book is suitable for undergraduates and evenadvanced high school students.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Projected completion date:</span> Endof October 2006. <br><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span><br><big style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Geometric methods in harmonic analysis</span></big>,with Eli Liflyand <br><br>In this book we study harmonic analysis problems that have anon-trivial higher dimensional geometric flavor. Particular emphasis isplaced on the method of stationary phase and related problems. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Projected completion date</span>: Endof 2006. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br><big style="text-decoration: underline;">Orthogonal bases, tiling andthe Fuglede conjecture</big></span>, withMihalis Kolountzakis <br><br>In this book we describe the past and current developments pertainingto the Fuglede conjecture which links the existence orthogonal basesand tiling properties of sets. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Projected completion date</span>:unclear<br><br><br></body></html>
