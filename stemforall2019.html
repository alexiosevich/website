          The goal of Grad Stem For All is to empower and further
          inspire all interested students from colleges and universities
          in Western New York area to pursue advanced degrees in STEM
          fields, particularly mathematics and statistics. We are
          especially looking to involve groups that have traditionally
          been underrepresented in STEM, including women and
          underrepresented minorities. Our goal is to provide these
          students with the information, skills and training needed to
          succeed in graduate school, academic careers, and industry.
          The three components of the program are coursework, research
          and mentoring. During the summer, faculty from local
          universities will be teaching a series of mini-courses that
          will enhance the undergraduate education the students receive
          at their liberal arts institution. These mini-courses are
          meant to be a preview of graduate coursework and provide
          students with a deeper background in mathematics and/or
          statistics. Each student participant will also be paired with
          an experienced faculty mentor from an area college or
          university, who can provide support and guidance throughout
          the student's college career and beyond. By having an
          identified mentor, students will more readily be able to get
          involved in research projects, learn about graduate schools,
          get advice on the application process, and learn more about
          life in academia in general. We intend for the mentor/student
          relationship to be long lasting, inspiring students to pursue
          advanced coursework and careers in STEM field. After the
          mini-courses, the program is going to enter the research phase
          where the students are going to be guided through a series of
          accessible open problems. <br>

          the program is organized by Dr. Cheri Boyd from the Department
          of Mathematics at Nazareth College. Critical to the success of
          these efforts are the cooperation from faculty from the School
          of Mathematics from Rochester Institute of Technology, and
          other faculty and graduate students from these departments. We
          hope to expand this list to cover every college and university

          <u><big><b>Mentoring: </b></big></u>Every participant in our
          program will be assigned to a mentor, who will assist them
          with course selection, advise them on additional readings and
          help them seek out graduate and professional opportunities.
          The participant will be able to maintain phone and email
          contact with the mentor, in addition to regular meetings. <br>
          <br>
          <u><b><big>Mini-courses:</big></b></u> The first wave of
          summer courses will be offered in July, 2019. Students will be
          responsible for their housing and transportation to the
          program. Each mini-course will run Monday through Friday for a
          two-week period. <br>
          <br>
          Each program will be followed by an informal two-week followup
          where the interested students can explore the topics in more
          depth with the instructor based on the background they have
          gained during the initial phase of the program. Long term
          research opportunity plans can be made for students who wish
          to continue the process once the program ends. <br>

              Description:&nbsp; A partition of an integer n is a
              multiset of positive integers whose sum is equal to
              n.&nbsp; For example, there are five partitions of 4,
              namely, 4, 3+1, 2+2, 2+1+1, and 1+1+1+1.&nbsp; In this
              course we will explore the various properties of integer
              partitions.&nbsp; Topics include partition identities and
              bijections, Ferrer's diagrams and Durfee squares,
              partition generating functions, and partition congruences.<br>

              <u><br>
                Description</u><u>:</u> We are going to focus on the
              sum-product phenomenon for subsets of the integers and
              subsets of cyclic groups of prime order. The question is,
              can the set of pairwise sums and the set of pairwise
              products of a finite sum be simultaneously small. The idea
              is that addition and multiplication are very different
              operations, so it is difficult for a set to both resemble
              an arithmetic progression and a geometric progression.
              Remarkably, this problem can be studied from a geometric
              point of view using rather elementary ideas that do not
              require much background to absorb. </small></big><br>

              cutting edge mathematics</font></b><br>
          Prerequisites: two semesters of first year calculus and high
          school geometry <br>
          <br>
          <u>Description:</u> Euclid's axiomatic treatment of geometry
          in The Elements was, among other things, remarkable for its
          amazing and unparalleled&nbsp; precision and rigour, neither
          of which were surpassed until the founding of truly modern
          mathematics in the 1800's. Nonetheless, the original work is
          somewhat poorly understood by many for what it does and does
          not do. In particular, for all the rigour with which it treats
          its subject, a truly axiomatic treatment of geometry had to
          wait until certain modern mathematical concepts, such as
          continuity, could be completely formulated. In this two week
          course, we will carefully examine the foundations of Euclidean
          geometry from the point of view of Euclid's original axioms
          from the Elements. We will discuss the limitations of these
          axioms and the modern notions which quite literally filled
          gaps in several important classical results. The second part
          of the course, we will discuss how Euclid's formal treatment
          of geometry, namely the Parallel Postulate, led to the
          discovery of&nbsp; so called non-euclidean geometries and
          ushered in a new era of modern mathematics and physics. We
          will conclude the class with a discussion of some modern open
          problems in geometry<br>

          Prerequisites: Two semesters of calculus (required). <br>
          <br>
          <u>Descriptio<font color="#333333"><b>n:</b></font></u> Knot
          theory is an accessible and exciting area of math with
          connections to geometry, topology, physics, and abstract
          algebra, among other fields. It has also seen great progress
          in the last few decades with the invention of powerful new
          ways to study knots, such as the Jones and HOMFLY polynomials.
          We will start with a hands on introduction to knot theory and
          work through lots of examples. We will then focus on
          polynomial knot invariants and investigate exactly how much
          these polynomials can tell us about knots.<br>
