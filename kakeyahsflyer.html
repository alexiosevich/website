While this problem has proved to be very difficult, it requiresvery little background and the basic concepts are easily accessible tohigh-school students. The BK conjecture says, roughly speaking that ifa set determines lots of different slopes, then the set itself must bequite big. In spite of its apparent simplicity, this problem is still unsolved.It is my hope to convince you to think about this beautiful problem which,as you will see, is so easy to state, yet so difficult to solve.</font></font><p><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>We shall begin by discussing somebasic counting techniques and methods for estimating sums. We shall thenmove on to the aforementioned Besicovitch/Kakeya problem and this is wherethe fun really begins!</font></font><p><font color="#000000"><font size=+1><b>Sructure of the program: </b>Onmost days, we shall begin with a 50 minute lecture, from 1:00 p.m.-1:50p.m., followed by a short break. A problem solving periiod of about onehour is followed by another break. We shall conclude each day by summarizingwhat we have learned up to that point and answering questions.</font></font><p><font color="#000000"><font size=+1><b>PLEASE SIGN UP! </b>If you thinkyou may be interested in the program, please send me an email! In additionto being lots of fun, this program will look great on your college applicationand even later.</font></font><p><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>A preliminary set of lecture noteswill appear on my web page (http://www.math.missouri.edu/~iosevich/kakeyahs.pdf)by April 6, 2004. Please feel free to start reading and asking me questions.I will respond as promptly as I can.</font></font><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><br><center><p><b><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>I HOPE TO SEE YOU ALL IN AUGUST!</font></font></b><p><b><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>PLEASE DO NOT FORGET TO FILLOUT AND SEND IN THE REGISTRATION FORM!</font></font></b></center><p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></body></html>
