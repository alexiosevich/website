<big>Raison d'etre:</big></span> <br>
<br>
The last decade has seen a flurry of exciting new results that have
utilized analytic methods to solve combinatorial problems. These
methods include Fourier analysis, functional analysis, analytic number
theory, spectral operator theory, and many others. Conversely, there
have also been exciting advances in the applications of combinatorics
to analysis, most notably to harmonic analysis. There is a growing need
for a journal specifically dedicated to publishing this type of work
and providing a natural habitat in which it can flourish. For these
reasons we decided to launch the <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Online Journal of Analytic
Combinatorics</span> &nbsp;(<span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">OJAC</span>).<br>
<br>
We will publish papers on a wide range of subjects, from analysis to
number theory to combinatorics, with emphasis on the convergence and
interactions between these fields. &nbsp;We particularly encourage
submission of articles which may have one of the following features:<br>
<br>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">1. Combinatorial results and
analytic methods. </span><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">2. Analytic results and
combinatorial methods.</span><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">3. A mixture of combinatorics and
analysis in the methods or in their
applications.</span><br>
<br>
We expect that this will often include papers which, because of their
interdisciplinary nature, may be hard to classify and difficult to
publish in a journal specializing in only one area of mathematics.<br>
<br>
We also encourage submission of short <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">letters</span>
(1-3 pages) describing
open research problems of current interest that fall within the scope
of the journal.<br>
<br>
All contributions will be peer-refereed. Our pledge to the authors and
readers is to ensure a timely and competent refereeing process,
followed by prompt publication in the case of accepted papers.&nbsp;
Each paper will be refereed by two experts who will be paid <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">$50</span> each
for a timely report. <br>
<br>
Our journal will be available electronically, free of charge. As a
result, it will be easily accessible to mathematicians around the world
who might
otherwise be deterred from subscribing due to financial
considerations.&nbsp; At a later date, we may consider publishing a
printed version of this journal but only if this can be done without
compromising the principles and pledges stated above. <br>
<br>
The authors of the accepted papers will receive 50 off-prints free of
charge. The off-prints will be produced by the University of Missouri
with the artistic input from Sinai Robins. <br>
<br>

<br>
<big>Information
for readers and authors:</big></span> <br>
<br>
This journal will start out as an on-line journal. Its eventual
permanent web address is <a href="http://www.ojac.org">http://www.ojac.org</a>.
The temporary web address of the journal is <a
 href="http://www.math.missouri.edu/%7Eiosevich/ojac.html">http://www.math.missouri.edu/~iosevich/ojac.html</a>.
The
first issue is scheduled to come out on <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">January
15, 2006</span>. <br>
<br>
As we mention above, we will request two referee reports for each
paper. Each referee will
be paid <span style="font-weight: bold;">$50</span> if he or she
submits the report in four weeks or less. <br>
<br>
Papers are to be submitted electronically to <a
 href="mailto:ojac@math.missouri.edu">ojac@math.missouri.edu</a> in
either <span style="font-weight: bold;">AMS TeX, LaTeX, or AMS LaTeX</span>
formats. Instead of sending us a file with the paper, the authors are
welcome to simply send us a link to the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">arxiv</span> submission. <br>
