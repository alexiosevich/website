books,    both   mathematical     and non mathematical, that one of us has 
recently<br>
                     read and really liked. If you have any comments or suggestions,

                  <font color="#000099"><u>Proofs from the book, Martin Aigner 
   and   Gunter  Ziegler</u></font> (book-mathematics)  <br>
                     <br>
                     Erdos often talked about The Book where God maintains
 the   perfect     proofs    of mathematical theorems. In this wonderful
book,  originally   started   by  Erdos himself, Aigner and Ziegler give
beautiful  proofs of  numerous fundamental     results in number theory,
combinatorics,  analysis,  and other areas. <br>

                   <font color="#000099"><u>Freedom and its betrayal; six 
enemies     of  human   freedom, Isaiah Berlin</u></font>  (book-philosophy/political 
    science)  <br>
                  <br>
                  In this wonderful book, Isaiah Berlin, one of the most
respected      thinkers     of the 20th century, takes on some of the icons
of Western    liberal  thought:     Helvetius, Rousseau, Fichte, Hegel, Saint-Simon,
and   Maistre.  He attempts     to expose their views as dangerously totalitarian
   in nature,  in spite of   outward appearances. While exaggerations are
almost   inevitable  in this type   of analysis, Berlin's arguments are bold,
non-trivial   and very original.   <br>
                  <br>
                  A detailed review of this book will appear on this page 
at some point.&nbsp;    <br>

<font color="#000099"><u>   Fourier Analysis: An Introduction (Princeton
Lectures in Analysis, by Elias  M. Stein and Rami Shakarchi</u></font> (book-mathematics).
<br>
  <br>
  This is a beautiful introduction to Fourier analysis in many of its manifestations.
 In addition to fairly standard material, the book discusses applications
to number theory, geometry and other areas. The book is highly readable and
requires very little background- a perfect text for first year graduate students
or advanced undergraduates. <br>
