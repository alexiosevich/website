<p><font color="#cc0000">Spicy Seafood Soup:</font>
</p>
<p>This recipe resulted from watching several cooking shows over a
period
of several weeks, confusing and forgetting the resulting information
and
wild experimentation. Here is the result.
</p>
<p><font color="#3333ff">Ingredients: </font>1 lb. large shrimp (the
larger
the better...) 1lb. of large sea scallops, 1 lb. of any firm fish
fillets
cut into bite size pieces, 2 carrots, 3 zucchini, 1 yellow squash,
mushrooms,
three tomatoes, chopped onions, lots of garlic, hot peppers, cayenne
pepper,
and white wine.
</p>
<p><font color="#3366ff">Directions:</font> Heat up some good olive oil
in a large cooking pot. Add some finely chopped onions and pre blenched
carrots. A few minutes later add the zucchini, yellow squash,
mushrooms,
hot peppers and lots of garlic. A minute later add the shrimp,
scallops,
fish fillets and hot peppers. Immediately add the finely chopped
tomatoes.
Season with cayenne pepper and salt. Add 1/2 cup of white wine. Let it
cook for about 10 minutes. Taste it for the salt content before
removing
from the pan. Serves 4 hungry people or as many as 6 normal people.

<p><font color="#cc0000">Kielbasa 92:</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000000">This is a modification of a recipe I got from
Kevin Rowney who got it from Maria Morril. The name of the recipe has
evolved
over the years... The recipe itself has done some evolving of its
own...
The list of people who particularly enjoy this dish includes Marco
Rigoli
and Leonardo Colzani.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000099">Ingredients: </font><font color="#000000">Polish
sausage, ham, shrimp, regular rice, beef bouillon cubes, red beans,
dark
beer, lots of garlic and cayenne pepper.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000099">Directions: </font><font color="#000000">Brown
some Polish sausage and ham in a frying pan with some good olive oil.
Add
some water, beef bouillon cubes&nbsp; and rice to the frying pan. Keep
adding liquid in the form of dark beer to keep the rice from drying up.
About 15 minutes later add lots of garlic and season with cayenne
pepper.
When rice is about 10 minutes from being done, add the shrimp and red
beans.
Depending on the size of the frying pan, this will feed anywhere from 2
people to everybody on the planet.</font>

<p><font color="#ff0000">Spicy pasta with tomato sauce:</font><font
 color="#ff0000"></font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000000">Yep, your eyes are not deceiving you. Just a
simple
pasta with tomato sauce. We decided to describe this simple dish on our
web page because we still see hordes of silly people buying bad pasta
sauce
in the supermarket instead of making it themselves. Here is all you
have
to do. Get a bunch of regular tomatoes and a bunch of cherry tomatoes.
Cut the regular tomatoes into small pieces while pretty much leaving
the
cherry tomatoes alone. Saute the tomatoes in a frying pan with olive
oil,
garlic and cayenne pepper and salt. We sometimes add a touch of curry
when
we are bored. Keep cooking at a relatively high temperature until the
tomatoes
turn into a sauce like substance. Put a cooked pasta (don't overcook
it!)
into the frying pan and mix it all together.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000000">Try it and I promise you that you will never
want
to buy a pasta sauce from a jar again.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Beef and oyster stew </span><br>
</p>
<p>Another simple dish. The ingredients are: two pounds of beef stew
meat, two cans of oysters, a pound of carrots, three large onions, six
medium sized tomatoes,&nbsp; two heads of garlic, plenty of paprika,
salt and pepper, red wine, lemon, and lots of olive oil. Heat up some
olive oil in a stewing pot, cut up three large onions into medium sized
pieces and get started. After the onions cook down a bit, add
pre-blenched carrots cut into small pieces, followed by tomatoes, large
chunks of garlic, and the lemon. Cover everything by a generous layer
of paprika. After about fifteen minutes, add pre-browned cubes of beef,
also covered by a generous layer of paprika, and let the whole thing
cook for about ten minutes. At this point add the oysters and cover
everything by a cup (or two) of red wine. Let the resulting mixture
cook for another fifteen minutes, add salt and pepper to taste and
enjoy! <br>
