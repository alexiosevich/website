    Esen Aksoy was one of my first algebra oriented students. Her thesis
    was on geometric combinatorics in in modules over finite abelian
    rings where she was successfully able to adopt group action methods
    to produce a series of results about the distribution of triangles
    and related problems. After returning to Turkey, Esen continuing
    working on discrete problems, briefly shifting her focus to
    sum-product inequalities before returning to Erdos type problems for
    configurations that lack rigidity. <br>
    <br>
    Among my many great memories of working with Esen is her quiet
    demeanor and a great sense of humor. When she discussed even the
    most complicated aspects of her thesis with me and Jonathan
    Pakianathan, Esen always remained calm and focused. <br>
