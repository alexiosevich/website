      <div align="left">The purpose of this lecture series is to bring
        together undergraduate and graduate STEM students with former
        STEM majors who are now working in Data Science. Each lecture
        will begin with a 20 minute presentation by a former STEM major,
        followed by a question and answer session designed to give the
        participants a clear idea what it would be like to work in the
        data science field, and what skills they would need to acquire
        to successfully enter that industry. Some speakers are Ph.Ds and
        former research mathematicians. Others received undergraduate
        degrees in STEM fields and went into industry directly. The
        talks will take place on Mondays at 8 p.m. EST. <br>

    <br>
    <b>Abstract:</b> Take a stroll back to the days of macro hedge fund
    mania and its aftermath.&nbsp; I will review some of the work areas
    of my career as a buy-side quant working at an institutional mutual
    &amp; hedge fund manager in Boston.&nbsp; The focus will actually be
    on the domain knowledge and skill sets required for the job, and I
    will give some tips and pointers for the job market and for
    “surthriving” the corporate world.&nbsp; I will touch on some
    taxonomy of strategies in the space, and a handful of statistical
    and ML techniques which are appropriate.<br>

    <b>Title:</b> From Sandpiles to Missile Defense<br>
    <br>
    <b>Abstract:</b> Since finishing my postdoc in math at the
    University of Rochester, I have been working as an algorithm
    developer and software engineer for a defense contractor called
    SciTec. As a contractor for the federal government, we develop tools
    to protect our nation from evolving threats. Due to the complexity
    of modern threats, we rely on mathematical algorithms and AI systems
    to respond to new and unexpected scenarios. I will speak about the
    company and the many applications of math to missile defense and
    software engineering.<br>
