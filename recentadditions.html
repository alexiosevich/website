Revised version of the paper entitled, "<a
 href="http://www.math.missouri.edu/%7Eiosevich/papers/gafa02.pdf">Sharp
rate of average decay of the Fourier transform of a bounded set</a>",
with
Luca Brandolini and Steve Hofmann. Many thanks to the referee for
helpful
remarks that led to these revisions. The two main results have been
unified
and the proofs shortened. The main result says that if a bounded set in
d-dimensional Euclidean space is either convex or has a C^{3/2}
boundary,
than the spherical L_2 average of the Fourier transform of the
characteristic
function of this set decays of order $-(d+1)/2$ at infinity, same as
the
point-wise decay rate of the Fourier transform of the characteristic
function
of the unit ball.

Fuglede
Conjecture!</a></font> A few days ago Terry Tao buried the Fuglede
Conjecture
by exhibiting a union of cubes in five dimensions which has an
orthogonal
basis of exponentials but does not tile. Terry clearly demonstrates
that
orthogonality is much easier to come by in higher dimensions than is
tiling.
It is still plausible that the one-dimensional conjecture may be true.
Also, the conjecture in the convex case remains viable.

<p>Coming in a few days: "Weyl type formula for frames and spectra",
with
M. Kolountzakis. In this paper we prove good estimates for the error
term
involved in expressing the number of elements of a spectrum of a
bounded
domain with respect to an exponential basis in terms of geometric
properties
of the boundary. In this way we unify the asymptotic formula of
Beurling/Landau
with the spectral gap estimate obtained a few years ago by
Iosevich/Pedersen.

complexity of convex sequences</a>", with M. Rudnev and V. Ten, has
also
been submitted for publication. The main result of this paper is that
the
bound on the number of solutions of thdiophantine equation based on a
strictly
convex sequence with n elements, with d terms on each side, is
O(n^{2d-2+2^{-d+1}}).
This result says that in some sense, the O(n^{2d-2}) estimate valid for
the sequence of&nbsp; squares of integers, for example, is almost
purely
combinatorial, not number theoretic, in essence. We conjecture that
O(n^{2d-2})
bound should hold for any convex sequence.

<p><u>Coming soon</u>: Incidence theory in higher dimensions via
Fourier
analysis (with I. Laba and M. Rudnev). We obtain sharp incidence
theorems
for families of surfaces and well-distributed points in higher
dimensions
using L^2 theory of Fourier integral operators and diophantine
approximations.
We then apply these results to systems of diophantine equations,
distance
sets, and related problems.

A more or less final version of the paper, <a

analysis and combinatorial geometry"</a>, based on the series of
lectures
I gave in Padova in June 2002 is finally ready.&nbsp; The paper gives
a&nbsp;
very simple proof of the Szemeredi-Trotter incidence theorem due to
Szekely
and explains a connection between this problem and several problem in
harmonic
analysis and additive number theory. Several other problems in
geometric
combinatorics and their connections with Fourier analysis are also
described.
The final section of the paper discusses the connection between the
Erdos
Distance Problem and its continuous variant, the Falconer Distance
Problem.

speaking, that non-trivial L^2 bounds for averages over families of

theorems. When the geometric complexity is sufficiently high we are
able to obtain stronger results and those available in combinatorial
literature. Some corollaries for distance sets with variable
