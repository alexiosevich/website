    Among many enjoyable moments of my collaboration with Mike Bennett
    was the time when he made a beautiful observation that the group
    action mechanism in vector spaces over finite fields yields an
    immediate proof of the (d+1)/2 exponent in vector spaces over finite
    fields. He walked into my office and told me about it in a very calm
    manner. I did not believe Mike and politely diverted the
    conversation to something else. He came back a couple of hours later
    and politely insisted, so I asked him to write the argument on the
    board which convinced me very quickly. This was typical of my
    interactions with Mike Bennett. He was a hard-working and insightful
    student who frequently came up with interesting and unusual ideas. <br>

    My joint papers with Mike and others on group actions in the context
    of Erdos-Falconer problems in vector spaces over finite fields
    continue to influence my research to this day, and his dissertation
    serves as a very fine reference source for many ideas and
    calculations. <br>
