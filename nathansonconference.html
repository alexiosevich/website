This workshop is being organized by the New York Number Theory Seminar,<br>
and is supported in part by a grant from the Number Theory Foundation.&nbsp;
In<br>
addition to invited lectures there will be a session for contributed<br>
papers.&nbsp; Mathematicians, and especially graduate students, are<br>
encouraged to attend.&nbsp; We intend that the lectures will be sufficiently<br>
expository that the number theorists will learn from the harmonic<br>
analysts, and conversely.&nbsp; For further information, or to be added to
the<br>
email list for this workshop, please contact Mel Nathanson at<br>
nathansn@alpha.lehman.cuny.edu or by phone at (718) 960-8860.<br>
