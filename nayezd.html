<div style="text-align: left;">Mathematics Education, or MathEd for
short, has generated much controversy in research mathematics circles
for many years. Many pure mathematicians believe that most
practitioners of MathEd have weak mathematics backgrounds along with
hidden, and sometimes open, contempt for serious mathematics. The
presence of a small numbers of prominent mathematicians in MathEd does
little to assuage these concerns for reasons too obvious to mention.
The fact that many people involved in MathEd are honest and hardworking
people also, unfortunately, does not help much in the grand scheme of
things, because the movement they represent is flawed at its core. The
purpose of this essay is to make a case that MathEd establishment is a
threat to mathematics education, and also to the research mathematics
community. I also wish to propose some possible remedies. <br>
<br>
There is an obvious point which seems to be lost on many people in this
age of
deteriorating intellectual freedom. No academic discipline is immune
from criticism. Furthermore, even the validity of a discipline as a
whole is open to question and even ridicule. Several MathEd
practitioners I have communicated with urged me to engage in
&#8220;constructive&#8221; criticism, but this is difficult, if not impossible, if
one views the whole discipline as a form of unashamed
charlatanism. <br>
<br>
The main reason MathEd establishment and most of the practitioners
constitute a threat to mathematics education is because they have
created a bureaucratically complex research discipline out of a
methodologically simple and honorable art. Teaching is very simple and
very difficult at the same time. It is difficult in that it requires
much patience, organization, love, and dedication. At the same time,
teaching is simple in that beyond the knowledge of the subject,
willingness to understand the needs of the students, flexibility,
common sense and open mind, few other prerequisites or techniques are
required. From my personal experience, interaction with the students
gives a much better feel for teaching than any of the formal &#8220;training&#8221;
programs mathematicians are often subjected to as a teaching assistants
or junior faculty members. Occasional training directed to specific
shortcomings such as voice projection, black board management, and
other mechanical difficulties, can be useful, but that certainly does
not require a nation-wide
&#8220;research&#8221; apparatus. By turning education into a research discipline,
its promoters have created an environment where publication pressure
and a drive for &#8220;innovation&#8221; inevitably replaces common sense and
result oriented thinking. <br>
<br>
A less significant but a nevertheless annoying threat that MathEd poses
to theoretical mathematics is within the research mathematics
departments. Many
theoretical mathematicians who are involved in MathEd do not have
stellar research credentials in comparison with their colleagues. With
the infusion of
grant money that often comes from their participation in MathEd, it is
tempting for these individuals to argue for additional pay
raises and other symbols of respect and recognition. Unfortunately, the
amounts of money MathEd commands at the National Science Foundation is
so relatively huge, it may become increasingly difficult for university
administrators to ignore these demands. This may result in the
increased intrusion of MathEd
into research mathematics departments and the resulting chaos and lack
of prestige that will inevitably follow. <br>
<br>
As destructive the association with MathEd is, the idea of improving
the image of the research mathematics world, and fulfilling our duties
to the community, by increasing our profile in educational activities
is a good one. However, I believe that a very different approach must
be taken. Instead of associating ourselves with MathEd, we should make
our contributions at the local level by working with teachers,
organizing mathematics related activities, and fostering a positive
interaction between local schools and the university. By rejecting the
ridiculous notion that MathEd experts necessarily provide credibility
and essential expertise for such activities, we will both increase our
own positive profile and will rid
ourselves of a dangerous and disingenuous association. This is not to
say that cooperation with individuals from the MathEd world should
always be rejected- not at all! I can imagine many instances where
joint projects with competent and well-meaning MathEd experts could be
very useful, but the point is to avoid being subordinate to their
agenda and serving under their banner. <br>
<br>
Over the years, I had the honor and the pleasure of teaching many
talented and hard working individuals majoring in mathematics
education. I always took particular pride in teaching them because they
are the future mathematics teachers of America, people who will teach
our children. Several of these students complained that instead of
taking mathematics courses they need to understand the subject and
teach it effectively, their curriculum is filled with courses full of
psychobabble and pedagogical gobbledygook. Thus mathematics education
students are also
victims of the MathEd establishment, and their sub-standard training,
unworthy of their talents, portends a bleak future for the mathematics
education system in our country. <br>
<br>
And what should be done about elementary and high school teacher
training after MathEd is relegated to the trash bin of academic
history? The solution is simple because many developed countries have
already successfully addressed this problem. Prospective teachers will
be asked to get a degree in mathematics, and, in addition, will be
asked to take one or two courses in concrete pedagogical techniques,
taught by an experienced teacher. Summer internships geared towards
hands on teaching will complete the process that will result in a
degree in mathematics with specialization in teaching. <br>
<br>
I propose a creation of a web page to catalog educational activities by
research mathematicians. Such a site could be setup without much
difficulty and bureaucratic hassles. A group of moderators would
probably be needed to keep track of the incoming reports and screen
their content to a reasonable extent. We can also use his web page to
facilitate discussions among research mathematicians about how they can
get actively involved in educational activities depending on their
inclinations and the amount of time they are willing to spend. By
proceeding in this way we can not only create interesting and rewarding
opportunities for students and teachers, but we can also demonstrate
the usefulness and relevance of theoretical mathematics in education
and community work. There are much more qualified people than me to
undertake this task, but in order to launch the process, I will attempt
to keep track of educational activities by pure and applied
mathematicians on my web page at <a
 href="http://www.math.missouri.edu/%7Eiosevich/MathEdHome.html">http://www.math.missouri.edu/~iosevich/MathEdHome.html</a>.
Your assistance is essential in making this work. If you or anyone you
know is involved in a mathematical educational activity for elementary
or high school students, please let me know. <br>
<br>
In the end, the strongest case we could possibly make against MathEd
that the public at large will be able to appreciate is that we can get
things done and they cannot. In order to be able to make such an
argument, we need to go out and get results in a way that shows that
our training in pure or applied mathematics gives us a clear in edge in
passing on
knowledge and inspiring scientific interest and learning. Once we have
a body of work to point to, our case may well gain unexpected support
from the public and the political establishment.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
I do not blame those who wish to reform MathEd from within. It is
possible that I am being overly pessimistic and the current trend of
psychobabble and watered-down non-sense in mainstream MathEd will
eventually be replaced by more intelligent and constructive approaches
already advocated by some of its practitioners. My gut instinct tells
me that this is not going to happen, however. The spirit of social
activism that pervades MathEd, combined with widespread ignorance of
mathematics renders this discipline unsalvageable. Another way must be
found to address the many shortcomings of mathematics education in this
country and serious mathematicians can and should play an important
role
in this process<br>
<br>
Two types of people will likely read my essay- those who already agree
with the basic theme, and those who want me tarred and feathered. This
essay is not meant as a source of information, however, but rather as a
(figurative) call to arms. If MathEd were simply a source of pitiful
incompetence and garden-variety buffoonery, I would be content to sit
back and laugh about it with my friends. Unfortunately, the growing
influence of MathEd is destroying mathematics education in this country
and endangering our children&#8217;s future. Therefore, sitting idly by is
not an option. <br>

I look forward to your comments and suggestions. Please let me know if
it would be all right to have your comments posted on my web page,
either anonymously or with your name attached. I pledge to honor your
wishes in this regard to the letter. It is all too easy to laugh at the
MathEd shenanigans, but unfortunately the situation is not particularly
funny. Let us do something about it and improve elementary and high
school mathematics education in the process. <br>
