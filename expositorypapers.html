    <p><b><u>Kakeya Lectures:</u></b> </p>
    <p>A series of lectures on the Kakeya problem, the restriction
      conjecture, and related issues, delivered at the probability
      learning seminar at the University of Missouri-Columbia during the
      first semester of 2000. </p>
    <p><a href="expository/seminarlecture1.pdf">Lecture #1: Kakeya
        problem, Kakeya maximal operator, and the restriction
        phenomenon: connections and relationships</a> </p>
    <p><a href="expository/seminarlecture2.pdf">Lecture #2: Adventures
        in the plane</a> </p>
    <p><a href="expository/seminarlecture3.pdf">Lecture #3: Higher
        dimensional adventures: n+1/2 and discrete n+2/2</a> </p>

    <p><b><u><a href="expository/FugledeLattice.pdf">Fuglede conjecture
            for lattices:</a></u></b> </p>
    <p>This short note gives a simple proof of a theorem due to Fuglede
      which says that the statement that the lattice L tiles a domain in
      Euclidean space is equivalent to the statement that the dual
      lattice generates an orthogonal basis of exponentials for L_2 of
      this domain. An even shorter proof can be given using the Poisson
      Summation Formula. The proof here was designed to be almost
      completely self-contained, so the PSF is essentially reproved in
      the course of the argument. <br>

    <p><a href="expository/roth03.pdf"><b><span>Roth's theorem on
            arithmetic progressions:</span></b></a> <br>
    </p>
    <p>In this note we give a simple and self-contained proof of Roth's
      theorem which says that the any subset of the positive integers of
      positive density contains an arithmetic progression of length
      three. <br>

    <p style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="falcsteintomas.pdf">Proof of
        Falconer's distance set estimate via Stein-Tomas</a><small> : <br>
      </small></p>
    <p>In this note we use the Stein-Tomas restriction theorem to prove
      a result due to Falconer which says that if the Hausdorff
      dimension of a set is greater than (d+1)/2, then the Lebesgue
      measure of the set of distances is positive. This point of view
      has let to some interesting advances in recent years in papers by
      Bourgain, Wolff, Erdogan and others. <br>
