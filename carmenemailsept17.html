They are all interested<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; They are<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Gary Solbrekken:&nbsp;&nbsp; solbrekkeng@missouri.edu<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;mailto:solbrekkeng@missouri.edu&gt; (DUG Mechanical)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Frank Feng:&nbsp;&nbsp; FengF@missouri.edu&lt;mailto:FengF@missouri.edu&gt; (DGS<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mechanical)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; John Critser: critserj@missouri.edu<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;mailto:critserj@missouri.edu&gt;&nbsp; (Chair Vet Med)<br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; I suggest that you pool the other successful contacts makeby<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; other members of the Committee and that we at least hostone<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; joint meeting to discuss the grant with all of thesepeople and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; us. We must find at least one department to partner on thegrant.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I at least would like to offer some response to thepeople I<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; have contacted.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Carmen</body></html>
