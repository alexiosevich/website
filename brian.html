    <b>Things to do:</b> <br>
    <br>
    i) Use Rudnev's result and the tree technique from Ou and Taylor to
    obtain the 5/4 result for trees in two dimensional vector spaces
    over prime fields. Look at the proof of Theorem 1.1 in Ou and
    Taylor. Use the same combinatorial setup, with Rudnev's result as
    input instead of GIOW. <br>
    <br>
    ii) Recover the result for the quadrilateral. More precisely, obtain
    a better exponent for the quadrilateral than A. McDonald's exponent
    for the rigid object on four vertices. <br>
    <br>
    iii) Make sure that we are not full of crap on the lack of
    applicability of Rudnev's result to triangles. <br>

    iv) Use the analytic interpolation scheme we discussed before to
    obtain a non-trivial exponent (i.e beat A. McDonald's rigidity
    exponent) for a finite number of simplexes that share a single
    point. <br>
