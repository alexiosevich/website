    <u><b><big>Overview:</big></b></u> The goal of Grad Stem For All is
    to empower and further inspire all interested students from colleges
    and universities in Western New York area to pursue advanced degrees
    in STEM fields, particularly mathematics and statistics. We are
    especially looking to involve groups that have traditionally been
    underrepresented in STEM, including women and underrepresented
    minorities. Our goal is to provide these students with the
    information, skills and training needed to succeed in graduate
    school, academic careers, and industry. The three components of the
    program are coursework, research and mentoring. During the summer,
    faculty from local universities will be teaching a series of
    mini-courses that will enhance the undergraduate education the
    students receive at their liberal arts institution. These
    mini-courses are meant to be a preview of graduate coursework and
    provide students with a deeper background in mathematics and/or
    statistics. Each student participant will also be paired with an
    experienced faculty mentor from an area college or university, who
    can provide support and guidance throughout the student's college
    career and beyond. By having an identified mentor, students will
    more readily be able to get involved in research projects, learn
    about graduate schools, get advice on the application process, and
    learn more about life in academia in general. We intend for the
    mentor/student relationship to be long lasting, inspiring students
    to pursue advanced coursework and careers in STEM field. After the
    mini-courses, the program is going to enter the research phase where
    the students are going to be guided through a series of accessible
    open problems. <br>

    Take a look at
    https://people.math.rochester.edu/faculty/iosevich/stemforall2021.html
    for the Tripods2021/StemForAll2021 program in data science running
    in July/August. <br>
    <br>
    <u><big><b>Mentoring: </b></big></u>Every participant in our
    program will be assigned to a mentor, who will assist them with
    course selection, advise them on additional readings and help them
    seek out graduate and professional opportunities. The participant
    will be able to maintain phone and email contact with the mentor, in
    addition to regular meetings. <br>

    <font size="+1"><b>Description of the program:</b></font> In this
    reading group, the students will work in pairs and deliver lectures
    based on the material in Manfredo Do Carmo's classic text on
    Riemannian Geometry. The participants will deliver the lectures
    under Professor Kleene's mentorship. The goal is to cover most of
    the fundamental concepts of differential geometry by the end of the
    program. <br>
