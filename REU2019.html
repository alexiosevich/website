    Data Science has taken both the academic and industrial scene by
    storm in the past decade. While the general concept-the analysis of
    large data sets- is at the core of this discipline, it would be
    difficult to pinpoint what precisely data science is and what it is
    not. In this summer program I would like to explore what elementary
    mathematical techniques have to say about the analysis of large data
    sets. The emphasis will not necessarily be on the techniques that
    are currently prevalent in the data science industry. My thought is
    that if you learn how to improvise and introduce new ideas, you will
    do well as you can learn or have already learned the standard fare
    in your undergraduate computer science or data science classes. <br>

    We are going to meet twice a week at an agreed upon time. We shall
    begin with a crash course on python. My guess is that most of the
    participants will arrive knowing more python than I do. This would
    be great because I hope to learn in this program as much as I look
    forward to teaching. We shall follow this up with a crash course on
    basic statistics. As the next step, we shall brainstorm some
    classical and accessible mathematical concepts that have a bearing
    on the analysis of large data sets. The emphasis will be new angles
    and ideas which we shall test by writing python code and applying it
    to a variety of data sets that we shall obtain from open sources. <br>
