          </b>The combinatorics group at the University of Rochester
          consists of Alex Iosevich and Jonathan Pakianathan. Several
          other faculty members are interested in the subject matter and
          attend the seminar. The seminar will generally meet on
          Thursdays at 5 p.m. EST, though adjustments will be made when
          necessary, especially for zoom talks involving large time zone
          differences. When the seminar meets in person, it will take
          place in Hylan 1106A, on the 11th floor of the Hylan Building
          at the University of Rochester. <br>

          <br>
          <b>Abstract: </b>We prove that if a family of compact
          connected sets in the plane&nbsp;has the property that every
          three members of it are intersected by a&nbsp;line, then there
          are three&nbsp;lines intersecting all the sets in the family.
          This answers a&nbsp;question of Eckhoff from 1993, who proved
          that, under the same condition, there are four&nbsp;lines
          intersecting all the sets. We also prove a colorful version of
          this result, under weakened conditions on the sets, improving
          results of Holmsen from 2013.&nbsp;Our proofs use the
          topological KKM theorem. Joint with Daniel McGinnis.&nbsp; <br>

          <b><br>
          </b><b>Abstract</b><b>:</b> </font><font size="+1"><font
            size="+1">Radon theorem plays a basic role in many results
            of combinatorial<br>
            convexity. It says that any set of d+2 points in R^d can be
            split into<br>
            two parts so that their convex hulls intersect. It implies
            Helly theorem<br>
            and as shown recently also its more robust version,
            so-called fractional<br>
            Helly theorem. By standard techniques this consequently
            yields an<br>
            existence of weak epsilon nets and a (p,q)-theorem.<br>
            <br>
            We will show that we can obtain these results even without
            assuming<br>
            convexity, replacing it with very weak topological
            conditions. More<br>
            precisely, given an intersection-closed family F of subsets
            of R^d, we<br>
            will measure the complexity of F by the supremum of the
            first d/2 Betti<br>
            numbers over all elements of F. We show that bounded
            complexity of F<br>
            guarantees versions of all the results mentioned above.<br>

            <b>Title:</b> Decidability and periodicity of translational
            tilings<br>
            <br>
            <b>Abstract: </b>Let G be a finitely generated abelian
            group, and F_1,...,F_J&nbsp; be finite subsets of G.&nbsp;
            We say that&nbsp; F_1,...,F_J tile G by translations, if G
            can be partitioned into translated copies of&nbsp;
            F_1,...,F_J.&nbsp; Given some finite sets F_1,...,F_J in G,
            can we decide whether they admit a tiling of G?&nbsp;
            Suppose that they do tile G, do they admit any periodic
            tiling?&nbsp; A well known argument of Hao Wang ('61), shows
            that these two questions are closely related. In the talk,
            we will discuss this relation, and present some results, old
            and new, about the decidability and periodicity of
            translational tilings, in the case of a single tile (J=1) as
            well as in the case of a multi-tileset (J&gt;1).&nbsp; The
            talk is based on an ongoing project with Terence Tao. <br>

          <b>Title:</b> Matching vertices of correlated random graphs <br>
          <br>
          <b>Abstract</b><b>:</b> Consider two copies of the same graph
          with a large number of vertices. In each copy, we
          independently delete a few edges. Our aim is to match exactly
          the vertices of the first and the second copy. This problem
          originates in particular in social networks, where you know
          the identities of users in one network and want to recover the
          identities in another one. This problem is computationally
          hard in a deterministic setting, so it is often considered for
          typical, i.e., random graphs. We will discuss a
          computationally efficient probabilistic algorithm that allows
          an exact recovery with high probability even if one deletes a
          small constant proportion of edges.<br>
