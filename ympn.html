      <div align="left">The purpose of this web page is to establish a
        national network for aspiring young physicists and
        mathematicians. Over the years I had the privilege of working
        with several talented high school students who had a keen
        interested in mathematics, including Tyler Salisbury-Jones,
        Allen Liu and Davey Fitzpatrick. I met Tyler when he walked into
        my summer program for high school students at the University of
        Missouri. Allen Liu was initially a student in Graph Theory
        class at the University of Rochester and Davey Fitzpatrick was
        recommended to me by a colleague, Steve Gonek, who was
        previously approached by Davey's father. These experiences made
        me wonder how many other young mathematicians out there simply
        do not have an idea who they might approach about studying
        mathematicians beyond their school curriculum. It would be great
        if the students could get on a website, type in their zip code
        and get a list of people living in the immediate vicinity who
        could help them realize their potential. <br>
        <br>
        In order to maintain proper standards and take the necessary
        safety precautions, I will initially only post lists of
        potential mentors who are current math or science teachers at
        accredited elementary schools, high schools or universities. In
        the future, I hope to expand the list to include retired faculty
        and volunteers from outside the academic world. <br>
        <br>
        In addition to contact information, this page is going to
        contain links to a variety of mathematical resources such as <a
          href="https://www.mathcircles.org">Math Circles</a>, school
        mathematics clubs, online learning materials and so on. <br>
