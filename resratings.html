<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: center;"><b
 style=""><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><big>Raise  recommendations</big><o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal">The following set of recommendation refers only to the
annual raise pool given to the department. The special merit raise pool,
if available, is at the Chair's discretion with advice from the Executive 
Committee. Among the factors that the Executive Committee may take into account
in advising the Chair on this matter are research monographs, quality of
invited lectures, inter-disciplinary research, and standing in the mathematical 
community. <br>
 </p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Note:</span> One
may get an impression that this document is not consistent with the 40% research,
40% teaching, 20% service principle because (see below) 75% of "merit" money
is allocated for research. However, this is not 75% of the total amount but
rather 75% of the amount after a certain "average" raise has been allocated.<br>
 </p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal">It has also been noted that four year averages do not
appear to come into play here. I envision modifying this scheme after it
runs for three years. At the moment, however, it does not seem to make sense 
to combine this system with the ratings used for the last three years. <br>
 </p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Stage 1:</span> Faculty
members are divided into four categories. <br>
 </p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Category I requirements:</span>
<br>
 </p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">At least one
paper in an "A" or "O" journal</span>. (accepted or published in a given year)<br>
 </p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal">A prestigious research award (see Appendix I), an NSF
research grant or a comparable foreign research grant, a plenary AMS address,
or an invited lecture at the ICM automatically place a faculty member into
Category I, provided that he or she has at last one accepted or published
refereed paper that year. The aforementioned research grants are counted
each year of their duration and for two years afterwards. A plenary AMS address
counts for five years. An ICM lecture counts for 10 years. The number of
years each award is counted (between 5 and 10) is listed in Appendix I. <br>
 </p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal">A paper in Annals of Math., Inventiones, Journal of
the AMS,  or Acta Mathematica automatically place a faculty member into Category
I for four years after the paper is accepted. <br>
 </p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal">A paper in Adv. in Math., Duke Math J., or Amer. J.
of Math. automatically place a faculty member into Category I for two years
after the paper is accepted. </p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal">One "O" paper and one "A" paper (or better) also automatically
place a faculty member into Category I. <br>
 </p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal">All chaired professors in the department are automatically 
placed in Category I provided they have at least one refereed paper that year.
<br>
 </p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal">An Associate Chair, an Undergraduate Vice-Chair, and
a Graduate Vice-Chair are automatically placed in Category II and may be
moved up to Category I at Chair's discretion. <br>
 </p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal">Finally, "O" and "A" categories need to be reworked
slightly to take Financial Mathematics journals into account. <br>
 </p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Category II requirements:</span>
<br>
 </p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">At least one
paper  in a "B" journal or higher</span>. (accepted or published in a given 
year)<br>
 </p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal">Any research grant, including the Missouri Research Board
Grant, automatically places a faculty member into category II. <br>
 </p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Category III requirements:</span>
<br>
 </p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">At least one
refereed paper.</span> (accepted or published in a given year)<br>
 </p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal">Any faculty member not satisfying the requirements of
the first three categories is placed into Category IV. <br>
 </p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Stage II:</span> Each
faculty member in Category I, II and III shall receive an equal percentage
raise. This percentage shall be determined by the Chair and will (of course)
be less than or equal to the total percentage raise allocated to the department
by the university.  Each faculty member in Category IV will also receive
this basic raise provided they satisfy <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">at least one</span> 
of the following requirements: <br>
 </p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal">(1) At least one refereed published or accepted paper
(in mathematics related disciplines) the previous year. <br>
 </p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal">(2) Teaching evaluations in the top 20% when compared
to the ratings others have received in the same class. <br>
 </p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal">(3) Served as a course coordinator. <br>
 </p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal">The remaining individuals receive a lower percentage
raise to be determined by the Chair with advice from the Executive Committee.
<br>
 </p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Stage III:</span> 
The remaining funds (to be assigned as l<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">ump sums, not percentage raises</span>) 
are divided into two categories: research (75%) and teaching/service (25%).
<br>
 </p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal">The research and teaching/service money is then distributed
among all eligible faculty members according to the criteria outlined below.
  <br>
 </p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal">Stage IV: 2/3 of the research money is distributed equally
among faculty members in Category I. The remaining 1/3 of the research money
is distributed equally among faculty members in Category II. The teaching/service
money is distributed equally among faculty members satisfying <u><b>at least
one</b></u> of the following criteria: <br>
 </p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal">(1) Teaching evaluations in the top 10% when compared
to the ratings others have received in the same class. This applies to undergraduate
classes only. <br>
 </p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal">(2) Significant extra-curricular activities related to
teaching or service. This determination is to be made by the Executive Committee
but a thorough explanation must be given in each individual case. <br>
 </p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal">(3) Advised a Masters or a Ph.D. student.<br>
 </p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal">(4) NSF Grant in Mathematics Education. <br>
 </p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal">(5) At least one refereed publication in Mathematics
Education. <br>
 </p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal">(6) Authorship of a textbook. <br>
 </p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal"><br>

 style="font-weight: bold;">Special merit raise recommendations</span></big></big> 
<br>
 </p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal">The following criteria should be used: <br>
 </p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal">(1) Member of the Executive Committee are not eligible
for a special merit raise for the duration of their term. <br>
 </p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal">(2) The main criterion for a special merit raise should
be a specific research accomplishment viewed as outstanding by the elite
members of the mathematical field in question. Concrete and verifiable evidence
must exist that this accomplishment has enhanced the reputation of the department.
<br>
 </p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal">(3) The Associate Chair, the Director of Graduate Studies
and the Director of Undergraduate Studies may receive a special merit raise
as compensation for dimished opportunity to engage in teaching and research.
