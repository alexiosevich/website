    Krystal Taylor is a shining testament to what talent and
    determination working together can do. Krystal walked into my office
    at the University of Missouri in 2006 and made it very clear that
    she wants to become a successful research mathematician. After
    ripping through the preliminary exams where she outscored the vast
    majority of students who often had a much more extensive
    undergraduate mathematics background, Krystal wrote a very
    interesting PH.D. dissertation on the applications of Generalized
    Radon transform methods to problems in geometric measure theory and
    lattice point counting. She moved with me to the University of
    Rochester in 2010 and became my first PH.D. student at UR. <br>

    My collaboration with Krystal continues to this day. In
    collaboration with Mihalis Mourgoglou we created a direct and simple
    approach to the study of distance sets that contain intervals. This
    line of research continued in collaboration with Allan Greenleaf. It
    has been very rewarding to observe Krystal develop as a
    mathematician over the years, from her postdoctoral days at the
    Technion to the tenured position at Ohio State University where she
    has excelled in every aspect of academic life. <br>
