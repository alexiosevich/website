              Analysis in Discrete, Continuous and Arithmetic Settings<br>

      <div align="left"><u><b>Purpose:</b></u> This is a graduate topics
        course in Fourier Analysis. The purpose of this course is to
        discuss some recent results related to Erdos-Falconer type
        problems in discrete, continuous and arithmetic settings, look
        for commonalities and differences among those results and then
        try to understand to what extent they can be extended to the
        setting of locally compact abelian rings. <br>
        <br>
        <u><b>Structure:</b></u> We shall meet twice a week for an hour
        and a half, though on some occasions I expect the discussion to
        last much longer. During the first meeting of each week we shall
        discuss the known results in finite field, p-adic, discrete and
        continuous settings. The second meeting of each week will be
        dedicated to the study of the background material pertaining to
        locally compact abelian groups. We shall mainly use <a

        <br>
        <u><b>Prerequisites: </b></u>The main prerequisite is willing
        to work hard and stay constantly engaged in the course. This is
        not a kind of a course where you can just sit back and see what
        the proverbial cat drags in. Everybody will be expected to
        participate in class discussion and everybody will be asked to
        give a presentation from time to time. <br>
        <br>
        As far as technical prerequisites go, everybody is expected to
        have a solid grasp of Tom Wolff'a <a
href="http://www.math.rochester.edu/people/faculty/iosevich/wolffnotes.pdf">Harmonic





          Analysis</a>, though we shall definite cover some of the
        topics in the beginning of the course. The participants are also
        expected to have basic grasp of undergraduate algebra and number
        theory. <br>
        <br>
        <u><b>Class notes:</b></u> I will continually post updated <a
          href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/bsrwjowac7avbhi/springnotes14.pdf">notes





        </a>for the class on this paper and I encourage you to start
        reading those long before the course begins in January. As you
        will see, the notes have two parts, consistent with the
        description of the structure of the course above. As the notes
        evolve, feel free to ask questions, point out corrections and
        send in suggestions. <br>
        <br>
        <u><b>Background materials:</b></u> I will post various notes on
        the material we should know in principle, but may not remember
        in practice. <br>
