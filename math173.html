        <br>
        The most important key to success in this course is to learn and
        internalize each proof and example within 24-48 hours of its
        presentation. <br>
        The course will proceed at a rapid pace and attempts to delay
        the absorption of details until the next exam, or even the next
        weekend are <br>
        likely to result in intestinal discomfort for everybody
        involved. <br>
