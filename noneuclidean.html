<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Grading:</span>
The grade in the class will be based on 12 weekly quizzes, each worth
%10 of the grade. The two lowest quiz grades will be dropped. Quizzes
will be based on homework problems which will
be assigned but not graded. Solutions to the quizzes will be posted on
this web page. It is important to note that quizzes will be cumulative
in the sense that a quiz given during the fifth week of the semester,
for example, may well contain a problem based on the material covered
several weeks earlier. This will require you to keep up with all the
material covered in the class at all times. A final examination will be
offered on a voluntary basis to students wishing to improve their
grade. <br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Review
sessions:</span> I will run a review session every Wednesday evening at
8:00-9:00 p.m. in GCB 117. <br>
