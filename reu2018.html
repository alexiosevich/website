    Summer is near and we will be running an informal summer research
    program, as usual. Who are we? We are Alex Iosevich, Vitaly Lorman
    and Jonathan Pakianathan. This year the program is going to center
    around combinatorial geometry. What are we going to do? We are going
    to review the basics of combinatorial geometry, read a couple of
    papers and then try to prove some some results that are currently
    open. We do not have a timeline, just the desire to understand as
    much as possible. The reading materials are enclosed below. If you
    are interested in participating, please email Alex Iosevich at
    iosevich@gmail.com. The program is going to begin in May right after
    the end of the semester and will continue as long as there is
    interest. <br>
    <br>
    Our first meeting will take place on Tuesday, May 15, at 10 a.m. in
    the math lounge on the 9th floor of Hylan. We are generally going to
    meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays, though additional meetings may be
    scheduled as needed. <br>
    <br>
    We are going to begin the program by reading a beautiful paper by
    Bourgain, Katz and Tao, entitled "<a href="bkt.pdf">A sum-product
      estimate in finite fields and applications</a>". When you start
    reading this paper, your initial reaction may be to run away
    screaming. This is completely normal as frustration is an integral
    part of research mathematics. The key is to follow up the screaming
    sessions with intensive reading and scribbling in order to
    understand what the paper is all about. <br>

    program so far: <br>
